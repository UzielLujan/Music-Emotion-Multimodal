What if I wanted to run and hide?
Vows and promises break, oh, hey no
It always ends like this

Earth to earth, ashes to ashes
Dreams to crumbles and love to dust
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes
Dreams to crumbles and love to dust

Deep in my heart I've been prayin', cravin' for
Someone like you to come and stay
Innocence died in my childhood
I would trust you, but I'm afraid

Earth to earth, ashes to ashes
Dreams to crumbles and love to dust
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes
Dreams to crumbles and love to dust

Can you heal this human nature wound?
Can you feel for all eternity?
Can you speak for once what is the truth?
Can we rise from our identity?
Lies is what we are made of
Lies is what we are made of

Earth to earth, ashes to ashes
Dreams to crumbles and love to dust
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes
Dreams to crumbles and love to dust
(Lies is what we are made of)
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes
Dreams to crumbles and love to dust
(Lies is what we are made of)
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes
Dreams to crumbles and love to dust

Lies is what we are made of
Lies is what we are made of"
6VeihScj0pNr6uGFxfzalq,Hot Water Music,Wayfarer,0.327,0.976,Q2_Angry,"It's a gamble, double down or don't
Step out if you want to, stay in if you're bold, and roll
Could be a sure shot, or just as well, a fold
Guessing's never easy and wishes never sold like gold
The wheels are turning, the world keeps burning and all fall
To sweet defeat, so complete
Oh, call it humbling or brand it stumbling
Don't stop living and don't stop sailing to meet what will be destiny
We are wayfarers
With a wish to stay alive
For a cause, for a dream
There's much to move in a moving sea
Could be a sure shot, or just as well, a fold
Guessing's never easy and wishes never sold like gold
How about a handle or something set to hold?
Love is everlasting when love is on the road, I'm told
We are wayfarers
With a wish to stay alive
For a cause, for a dream
There's much to move in a moving sea"
6HfUriaVuymw9EmYeG9WH5,Grinspoon,Bleed You Dry,0.392,0.651,Q2_Angry,"If I could give you life I would take the chance
To make you see how much
All peeps and forgotten plans, last one to feel your touch
And I watched you from the shadows, waiting for your coach
And they pushed right past in barrows
I'll bleed you dry, I'll bleed you dry
I'll bleed you dry, get your daughter high
Make your mother cry, I'll bleed you dry
I'll bleed you dry, I'll bleed you dry
I'll bleed you, I'll bleed you, I'll bleed you dry
Heard the click felt the air and the guns go bang
Force-fed a genocide
But the place and the time was sad
Filled with forgotten lies
And I watched you from the shadows
Pull over by my side
I was shot by a poison arrow
I'll bleed you dry, I'll bleed you dry
I'll bleed you dry, get your daughter high
Make your mother cry, I'll bleed you dry
I'll bleed you dry, I'll bleed you dry
I'll bleed you, I'll bleed you, I'll bleed you dry
And though it never made you happy
You're not dead
And all the people would like to show
You're found dead
As if gold ever made you happy
I'll bleed you dry, I'll bleed you dry
I'll bleed you dry, get your daughter high
Make your mother cry, I'll bleed you dry
I'll bleed you dry, I'll bleed you dry
I'll bleed you, I'll bleed you, I'll bleed you dry"

Don't waste your time on me
I’ve got nothing left to give
Take out all your memories
And hide them where you may never find them
'Cause I don't need them anymore
They say an eye for an eye
But you placed a blind spot between you and I
I went along for the ride, hoping things were different

But I should’ve left you alone, alone, alone
When I had the chance
High heels and a sharp knife, walking into my life
I'm sorry to say
I should've left you alone, alone, alone
When I had the chance
Just in case you ever forget me
I'm the same way that you left me

And I know it may be hard
But things had to happen for us this way
You chose to leave and I'm still the same
It's hard, I don't know what to say
Now I'm stuck with these feelings that won’t go away
And I tried and I tried, but I still see your face
Now I’m leaving with her, but I'm calling your name

Do you want him?
Do you miss me when I’m gone?
Do you ever feel at home
When the lights've gone on
And you're standing all alone?

I should've left you alone, alone, alone
When I had the chance
High heels and a sharp knife, walking into my life
I’m sorry to say
I should've left you alone, alone, alone
When I had the chance
Just in case you ever forget me
I'm the same way that you left me
I'm the same way that you left me, oh-oh
I'm the same way that you left me, yeah

And no
I'm the same
I'm the same
I'm the same

I should've left you alone, alone, alone
When I had the chance
High heels and a sharp knife, walking into my life
I'm sorry to say
I should've left you alone, alone, alone
When I had the chance
Just in case you ever forget me
I'm the same way that you left me

I should've left you alone, alone, alone
When I had the chance
I should've left you alone, alone, alone
When I had the chance
I should've left you alone, alone, alone

0mJUxFpEI1eAOIIfnNoZ4G,Cradle Of Filth,Hallowed Be Thy Name,0.225,0.972,Q2_Angry,"I'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life, and it doesn't have much time
'Cause at 5 o'clock, they take me to The Gallows Pole
The sands of time for me are running low
Motherfuckers!
Running low!

When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me
Can it be that there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?
Somebody, please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not so easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak!
Tears, they flow, but why am I crying?
After all, I am not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end?!


As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Someone cries from a cell, ""God be with you""
If there's a god, then why has he let me die?!
As I walk, all my life drifts before me
And though the end is near, I'm not sorry
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away
Mark my words, believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to see the truth
So when you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down there is just a strange illusion!



(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Hallowed be thy name
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Hallowed be thy name!
Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name!

A familiar façade, keys in locks

Unhinge the future

Winners and losers

Renegade are reflections made across a sharpened blade
In a house of mirrors you’re never alone
Welcome home!

To open is to invitе the unknown
In to flood your once square homе

Are you watching them back?
Windows to the souls surround you
What escapes when those panes crack?

But we all
Reside

On this rock, I lie, but I'm alive for good
And I just free myself for now from all what was wrong
Break the unbreakable
All the stars fearlessly bright
They call me out there
Order me to face the wind
My structure's alive, body's on the way
Don't bow down before the walls
Of fear and madness
They try to counter me
And strike me down to the ground again


Inexhaustible
The strength of fire is running through me
Spine-like beam of light
What mortal could ever break this force?
Unconstrained
I see at last my backbone straighten
Thy serpent made of bones
Finally rise up from the ground awaken

Beat your feet on the ground now, go"

See the park where we used to meet
And regret what you said on the night that you left
Every word echoes back in my head
I hope it aches when you see the truth
Feel the hell that you put me through
Left a weight to this day that I still can't escape
Let me down for the last time again

So call me heartless, call me cold

Which side of the fence are you standing on?
There will come a day not so far away
When the hunter becomes the prey

No han sido fáciles los días en este camino
Sangre y sudor, pero aún así no nos hemos rendido
Nunca vamos a parar, nunca nos van a parar
No nos van a detener, nunca nos verán caer

No cualquiera comienza desde cero en el camino
Se ve pelada, pero no es nada sencillo, mijo
Nuestra vida se iluminó, le dimos un sentido
No tengo miedo a nada, la fe siempre está conmigo

Se siente el miedo y el tеrror que tienen, llеgó su amenaza
Yo nomás los oigo, están pendejos, ¿qué les pasa?
No hay manera de bajarme, perro, prendimos la casa
Lefty se pasa de verga, Moler, ponme pausa
Bruja, me los aplaco, les cayó el más flaco
Su paro cardíaco, ligero cual tabaco
Pelea'a se la retaco, si hay pedo, pues yo saco
Si se quedan con hambre de verga, les doy un taco

Una vida desordenada hasta que me llamaron aquel día
La familia más pesada y ahora quiero hacer mercancía
La que amé no me amaba, pero aquí sigo viviendo
La calle me vio crecer, Discípulos del Concreto
Le hice caso a mi destino, acción a lo que quería
Y ahora estoy con los mejores de Mex fumando María
Traje el estilo mas fresco de buena reputación
Somos flacos pesados como el Zxmyr al microphone

Ya no deja de sonar el fono, puro ring ring
Ando con puro pesado como el puto Kingpin
En la cancha pura estrella, somos el Dream Team
Fin fin, pa' tu clika si los topo en el ring
Pura Alzada family, putazos de Bruce Lee
No se meta pa' mi cerro porque hay mucho grizzlie
Que si soy, que no soy, loco, gangsta o MC
Pero yo no sé de ustedes y ustedes de mí sí

Yeah, si no está claro, la remarco
Los de Alzada retumbando pa'l otro lado del charco
Mira que golazo me marco
Cree que me tiene cubierto y por la derecha me le desmarco
Ya me estoy preparando el arco, no te gusta largo
Fumando la que reparte el narco
Mi niño, puro flow de encargo, me cargo, ahí te encargo
Te la descargo en el pecho y me largo

Con la pluma un puma, como el pentapichichi
Un latino por los aires como el Richie, ah
Puras estrellas como peces en el agua, piscis
Su destino es morir como los Meeseeks
Y si mi estilo les suena potente
Esperen a que acabe toda mi gente
Los veo escamados como serpientes
Una buena nota, la A en la frente, excelente

Take it easy, ando cerca de los mejores
Todo el día sonando en los monitores
Entre homies, cervezas y productores
Entre líneas, cenizas y reflectores
¿Quiere ritmo? Aquí hay más, compa, ¿qué pasó?
Quedan botes hasta que nos caiga el sol
4 AM y ya traes toa' la del Guasón
Ya estás viendo doble, pero no es símbolo Masón

Bruja, pónmela y la entono, que ando bien clono
No me traiciones, yo no perdono
Soy de la calle, de la calle somos
Vivimos del rap, ya no hay otro modo
Pase, pase, manito, sírvame un pase, pase
Ya le robamos la base, base
Llegamos locos con clase, locos con clase, uh

Ya llegaron los de Alzada, prende la cámara y cámara
Tú nomás dale y cálmala, esta madre nunca acabará
Dispárala directo, pero que truene machín
Me ando pasando de riata desde que andaba en el ring
Siempre clean, por la lleca me verás
Siempre es el mismo patín, pa'dela, nunca pa'tras
La clavo en el calcetín, por eso no encontrarás
Yo sigo aquí con mi team, bien tranquilo y bien relax

Que no le cause pena
Somos los cabrones descontrolando el sistema (Yeah, yeah)
Un gladiador en la arena
Seguimos donde Alzada, perra, sin perdón ni pena
Aquí no hay máscara, mucho flow y táctica
Para esa manada de farsantes todo acabará
Ready sintiendo mi lírica, desde Ecuador sonando brutal
Vamos rompiendo fronteras, ya tú sabes que no hay nadie igual, ah

Alzada es el sello, no acepten imitaciones
Esta fiesta es privada, se entra con invitaciones
De noche en la madrugada nada es lo que supones
Sólo tu sabrás si te quitas o te pones
Tú checa el estilo que da cuando vengo pisando este camino
Para hijos de perra, mis pies en la tierra, saben cómo lo defino
No juegan como la juego tampoco le atinan como le atino
Esto es guanajuatense, cien porciento salmantino

Depurando mi alma en una escritura con sentimiento
Pasamos malos momentos a falta de un sustento
Pero hoy la cosa cambia y de lo que hago no me tiento
Y no me arrepiento de nada, mi cora' palpita lento
La ideología de un loco se mide por la escritura
Si no entiendes mi sinopsis, aquí no hay literatura
Soy su madre y su padre, quien los pondrá en cintura
La nueva rebelión, somos la industria más dura, ah

Somos los chicos del barrio
Con sueños y mentes de empresario
Hip-hop creamos para el vecindario
Ya varios días clavados en esto diario
Con el objetivo en la mente claro
La calle está caliente como esta base
Siempre aceleramos, nunca les damos chance
Otro gallo, otra neurona, que en paz descanse
El equipo siempre listo, vamos tras del jale

Todo el mundo con la mano para arriba
No importa lo que tú digas, mi gente está bien prendida, ey
Me dijeron que sigues copiando líneas
Chavito, ponte las pilas, se nota el miedo en tu clica, sí
Eres el lobo, tramposo
Tan majestuoso y tan venenoso
Los veo caer poco a poco
No son de oro, muchacho baboso

Con mi clica no se equivoquen si no quieres que te choquen
Tengo un chingo de ojos en la espalda, todos puestos pal' acto en el bloque
¿Viste como la coloqué?, los saco, me fumo un toque
No hay película de negros tampoco actitud de rockers
Por aquí vivimos relax sin ningún horario
No todos tenemos la misma suerte, el mismo barrio
Cada cabeza es un mundo de la galaxia andando
Yo solo quiero una oportunidad pa' to' mis warriors

Que te duela más el cuero antes que la camisa
Y aunque siempre voy aprisa, no dejo que me den misa
Del amor al odio hay risas y en mi bando ya no hay cupo
Sigo gastando más tinta en mi libreta como pulpo
Yo no tengo rastas, pero sigo a Marley
Tu un triciclo Apache, yo soy una Harley
Cortar y ensartar para nosotros un baile
Puro vato loco, soy como Miklo y Spider

Esto es Alzada Corp, loco güacha mi visión
A los puñetas y a las morras se les cae el calzón
Cuando me ven por todo México prendiendo el cantón
Solo me junto con reales, bro, no es que sea mamón
El Neto suena y zumba la casa
Los decibeles me alucinan, loco, ¿qué es esto, qué pasa?
¿Qué tranza? Que el que es inteligente comparte
Y los que no, pues, chinguen a su madre de mi parte

Tear into me now I don't feel the defeat

Don't recognize ones who'd die for me
I'll empathize if you stop talking

Would give up anything if I could pause life there

I was innocent - just a child
Transformed my brain into an evil thing
Now I'm a creature of the night
I'm a shadow in the darkness and I'm watching you
Though you can't see me I am always at your side
When I'm on your heels - you see how it feels
To sense the curse of Azrael
In the night - I'll come to you
Your life belongs to me
I wake you up - you stare at me
I'm the last thing that you'll ever see
The panic in your eyes that I have hungered for
Shows me you have realised the truth
Death comes to the dying - and before your eyes grow dim
The last word on your lips is Azrael
I will destroy your dreams
I will destroy your mind
I will destroy your soul
And then I'll take your life
Sometimes I remember the life I had before
I asked myself was it just a dream
When I close my eyes I see an ocean flowing blood
And in my sleep I hear those fearful screams
So lock your doors - remove the keys
I doesn't matter if you leave or stay
Wherever you go I'll be expecting you
Your resistance is the spice that I crave
When you imagine there's a movement in the shadows
The light around you weakens more and more
Prepare for the arrival of the uninvited guest
The angel of the darkness - Azrael
I will destroy your dreams
I will destroy your mind
I will destroy your soul
And then I'll take your life
When you imagine there's a movement in the shadows
The light around you weakens more and more
Prepare for the arrival of the uninvited guest

His pistol had been found

And as they led him to the dock
He knew that he'd been wronged

""You stand accused of robbery""
He heard the bailiff say
He knew without an alibi
Tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom

Over the hills and far away
For ten long years, he'll count the days
Over the mountains and the seas
A prisoner's life for him there'll be

He knew that it would cost him dear
But yet he dare not say
Where he had been that fateful night
A secret it must stay

He had to fight back tears of rage
His heart beat like a drum
For with the wife of his best friend
He spent his final night of freedom

Against the wall, and it's too tall

Stay back to get captured, take the fall

Accidents happen
All I know is you love me, that's really all that matters
And any who cross our paths are just collateral damage
At your side, got your lateral, back, your front, diagonal
Backwards, blackbirds, we attack like animals
When they threaten what we have it's a natural reaction
You'll lay a bitch flat on her back in a second flat for me
Who tries to take your man from you
It's blasphemy, another casualty, you'll go whatever route
Do whatever you have to do, you'd blast for me

Is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep? Well, let me try again
Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
I dominate break loops, givin' mics men-e-strual cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in 
Cobra
Packin' like a Rasta in the weed spot
Vocals will squeeze Glocks
MCs eavesdrop, though they need not to sneak

Destroy the loathsome, for they only
Weaken the machine

Run it all into the ground then rebuild
The constructs on the boundaries

And mother Earth doesn't love you
Our remorse has gone far beyond forgiveness
Until the rope runs out, run it all into the ground

Dat wil ik wel, dat wil ik niet

I scream into the void
So hold my hand, walk into oblivion
Go to the cocoon, transformation
The pain emporium
Stripped down and bleeding
Broken of everything but pride
These mental scars I try to hide
My head held in my hands
Scars of sanctity, hatred's purity
Loss of my equilibrium
My soul is turning to ash
This faithless sanitarium
So wave goodbye
Save a prayer
Don't you cry
Don't be scared
For I have thrived
With no fear
Let me die
I'll be there
Slaughter the martyr
Slaughter the martyr

Dawn of the desolate
Prayers to pestilence
Deeper I fall in this descent to madness
Nightfall my nemesis
Dreams drip with violence
Orgies of murder, vicious acts so senseless
Piece by piece the kingdom shatters
Reality in tatters
The curse of chaos slowly consumes
Bruised
Scarred and abused
Suffer my vengeance, paint the world in crimson hues
Paint the world in crimson hues

Time won't heal
This hate I feel
Can't close my eyes
Nightmares that terrorize

I lay paralyzed in homicidal rage
The anger driving me insane

Slaughter the martyr

Brutal and barbarous
Murder so merciless
This blood will quench the thirst for retribution
Heartless, this homicide
Justice so justified
Never last rites, there's only execution
Limb from limb, I tear his body
And leave the carcass rotting
The stench of death is all that atones
Stone
I stand alone
Upon the piles of my enemies' broken bones
Of my enemies' broken bones

Time won't heal
This hate I feel
Can't close my eyes
Nightmares that terrorize

I lay paralyzed in homicidal rage
The anger driving me insane
I lay paralyzed in homicidal rage
The anger driving me insane

Heartbreak, the cross I bare
Endless sorrow fills the blackened air
These pyres where love has died
A fire smothered, emptiness inside
Angel adorned, halo of bullet shells
Into the darkest depths, I cast them to rot in hell
The executioner, no judge, no trial
Killing the killers that perpetuate this act so vile


I lay paralyzed in homicidal rage (Homicidal rage)
The anger driving me insane
I lay paralyzed in homicidal rage (Homicidal rage)
The anger driving me insane, -sane

So wave goodbye
Save a prayer
Don't you cry
Don't be scared

With no fear
Let me die
I'll be there"

Lick on your neck
Feel the hot and cold
Get goosebumps
Remember that?
I wanna kiss you
On your collarbone
I know how to get you wet
Squeeze your back
Pull you so close
You feel my heartbeat
That passion when we're sexing
We're one
And you're a part of me
No relaxing, heavy breathing
Until you cum
Pardon me, I'm asking
When I make your nose numb
And toes curl
Is that the only time
You think about being my girl?
You're in my world
And me in yours
That's the most productive
Let's discuss what we need more of
Because now I'm at your belly button
Got your hair standing on end
Hard nipples and clit
Begging me to come in
I let my fingers do the walking
Then I put my tongue in
Massage that G-spot
Until you feel your body
Cumming again
I kiss your thighs to your feet
Massage your fingers
While you leak
Feel your tongue touch mine
The moment I push it deep
Music on
I'm grinding to the beat
Then you're riding me
We got time
You can cream three times
Easily
And you ain't even got to be with me"

Out of state soldiers join us to form a conglomerate
It's out of hate oppressed revolt from feeling that they gotta take
All the weight so we go to war to find another way
Intercept opposite forces entering our sick vicinity
It's killing me how wars that make no sense last an infinity
It's silly shit how a city gets mentally unfit
But really it gets worse when buildings set the scene for murders script
I know you heard of this crisis and what the price is
High stress amplifies the need for all your vices
But steer clear cause we're here in fear they're
Taking over everything and so we fight the war years
Fierce weapons speak for each side through open forum skies
Some die when bullets pierce the skin exploding inside
We provide a dream for our team look past the war scene
Dethrone the king, gain control, reign supreme
Aim high for your street regime
Look for unseen enemies hiding in the smoke screen

The town I live in got daily death so we're numb to feeling
Blood spilling got my whole block concealing
If cops come frisking we're felony risking
Catch 22 system either way you fall victim
The stage is set up the script is written so we get wet up
Now think about who dies when we let the lead out
We're killing family tragically
The enemy dividing those fighting against it weakening our infantry
We caught on to your big plan
Separate us into street gangs
Infiltrate the sets put some battles in effect
To distract from your dirty outfit, yeah

We rock the block that you got locked
Caught in a battle with crooked-ass cops
Heat we feel on crazy
Gang infested LA streets
We see the red concrete stains
And street platoons feel pain
Real soon times will change
And you will see the truth that we claim
Aim your sickness this way
In sick games, we reign insane
There's only one way to explain
And now you lay to die with broke frames

Enemies of the state take center stage
And watch the rules we violate
Now we recall and fall
For all sins of life and break the law
There's many us dangerous
Plenty of you want war we fight any
We walk the paths all lost
And bring LA P.D holocaust
Anybody gets rocked the truth
First your ass gets rocked and then shot
We see through the plot
City street teams get broke down and then got
Rot in ditches dug
To get filled up with government bitches
We see the police
And train to kill the brain of the all terrain beast
Work done by street families
Make us and the state enemies"

Its like I want to leave it all behind
Is it okay if I want to die? (Is it okay if I want to die?)
Is it okay if I want to die? (Is it okay if I want to die?)

A broken heart and strong mind
Been coping from the start but still I played my part until its all fine
But still it seems to take a long time
And I'm the type to make it happen
I ain't waiting until it all aligns
I'm trying to find a sign, I'm in my home envisioning
Been chilling all alone, just speaking to whoevеr's listening
God's who I've been signaling
Try but connections limitеd
Striving for new position and grinding, I'm never pivoting
Never fitting in the box they try to make me stay in
Got the power of a say 'n never minding what they saying
Got a vision that I'm chasing
Blind faith makes me feel like times wasting
Feel the walls are closing in as every day is
Should I be embracing and get ready for the casket?
I know there's plenty listening that's thinking its drastic
But it seems the pain is always coming back
Like a habit working magic, after years of working magic
I just can't escape the tragic so...

Is it okay if I want to die?

The things in life that I can't find

Lightweights step it aside when we come in
Feel it in your chest, the syllables get pumpin'
People on the street, they panic and start running
Words on loose-leaf sheet complete comin'
I jump in my mind and summon the rhyme I'm dumpin'
Healing the blind, I promise to let the sun in
Sick of the dark ways we march to the drummin'
Jump when they tell us that they wanna see jumpin'
Fuck that, I wanna see some fists pumpin'
Risk something, take back what's yours
Say somethin' that you know they might attack you for
'Cause I'm sick of being treated like I have before
Like it's stupid standin' for what I'm standin' for
Like this war's really just a different brand of war
Like it doesn't cater to rich and abandon poor
Like they understand you in the back of the jet
When you can't put gas in your tank
These fuckers are laughin' their way to the bank and cashin' the check
Askin' you to have compassion and have some respect

For a leader so nervous in an obvious way
Stutterin' and mumblin' for nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world watchin' at the end of the day
In the livin' room laughin', like, ""What did he say?""

Amen, amen
Amen, amen
Amen

In my livin' room watching, but I am not laughin'
'Cause when it gets tense, I know what might happen
The world is cold, the bold men take action
Have to react or get blown into fractions
Ten years old there, somethin' to see
Another kid my age drugged under a Jeep
Taken and bound, and found later under a tree
I wonder if he had thought the next one could be me
Do you see the soldiers that are out today?
They brush the dust from bulletproof vests away
It's ironic, at times like this, you'd pray
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday
There's bombs on the buses, bikes, roads
Inside your market, your shops, your clothes
My dad, he's got a lot of fear, I know
But enough pride inside not to let that show
My brother had a book he would hold with pride
A little red cover with a broken spine
On the back, he hand-wrote a quote inside
""When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die""

Meanwhile, the leader just talks away
Stutterin' and mumblin' for nightly news to replay
The rest of the world watchin', at the end of the day

The deep breath I took still poisons my lungs
An old oak sheltering me from the blue
Sun bathing on its dead frozen leaves

A catnap in the ghost town of my heart
She dreams of storytime and the river ghosts
Of mermaids, of Whitman's and the Ride
Raving harlequins, gigantic toys

A song of me a song in need
Of a courageous symphony
A verse of me a verse in need
Of a pure heart singing me to peace

All that great heart lying
Still
 and slowly dying
All that great heart lying
Still on an angelwing

All that great heart lying still
In silent suffering
Smiling like a clown until the show has come to an end
What is left for encore
Is the same old Dead Boy's song
Sung in silence

All that great heart lying
Still
 and slowly dying
All that great heart lying
Still on an angelwing


A midnight flight into Covington Woods
A princess and a panther by my side
These are Territories I live for
I'd still give my everything to love you more

A song of me a song in need
Of a courageous symphony
A verse of me a verse in need
Of a pure-heart singing me to peace

All that great heart lying
Still
 and slowly dying
All that great heart lying
Still on an angelwing

All that great heart lying
Still on an angelwing



A silent symphony
A hollow opus one, two, three

Sometimes the sky is piano black
Piano black over cleansing waters

Resting pipes, verse of bore
Rusting keys without a door

Sometimes the within is piano black
Piano black over cleansing waters


All that great heart lying
Still
 and slowly dying
All that great heart lying
Still on an angelwing
All that great heart lying
Still
 and slowly dying
All that great heart lying
Still on an angelwing


I see a slow, simple youngster by a busy street
With a begging bowl in his shaking hand
Trying to smile but hurting infinitely
Nobody notices
I do, but walk by
An old man gets naked
And kisses a model doll in his attic
It's half-light and he's in tears
When he finally comes his eyes are cascading
I see a beaten dog in a pungent alley
He tries to bite me
All pride has left his wild drooling eyes
I wish I had my leg to spare
A mother visits her son
Smiles to him through the bars
She's never loved him more
An obese girl enters an elevator with me
All dressed up fancy
A green butterfly on her neck
Terribly sweet perfume deafens me
She's going to dinner, alone
That makes her even more beautiful
I see a model's face on a brick wall
A statue of porcelain perfection beside a violent city, kill
A city that worships flesh

The first thing I ever heard
Was a wandering man telling his story
It was you, the grass under my bare feet
The campfire in the dead of the night
The heavenly black of sky and sea

It was us
Roaming the rainy roads
Combing the gilded beaches
Waking up to a new gallery of wonders every morn
Bathing in places no one's seen before
Shipwrecked on some matt-painted island
Clad in nothing but the surf, beauty's finest robe

Beyond all mortality
We are, swinging in the breath of nature
In early air of the dawn of life
A sight to silence the heavens

I want to travel where life travels
Following its permanent lead
Where the air tastes like snow music
Where grass smells like fresh-born Eden
I would pass no man, no stranger, no tragedy or rapture
I would bathe in a world of sensation
Love, goodness, and simplicity
(While violated and imprisoned by technology)

The thought of my family's graves
Was the only moment I used to experience true love
That love remains infinite, as I'll never be the man my father is
How can you ""just be yourself""
When you don't know who you are?
Stop saying ""I know how you feel""
How could anyone know how another feels?

Who am I to judge a priest, beggar, whore, politician, wrongdoer?
I am, you are, all of them already

Dear child, stop working, go play
Forget every rule
There's no fear in a dream

Is there a village inside this snowflake?
A child asked me
What's the colour of our lullaby?
I've never been so close to truth as then
I touched its silver lining

Death is the winner in any war
Nothing noble in dying for your religion
For your country
For ideology, for faith
For another man, yes

Paper is dead without words
Ink idle without a poem
All the world dead without stories
Without love and disarming beauty

Careless realism costs souls

Ever seen the Lord smile?
All the care for the world made beautiful a sad man?
Why do we still carry a device of torture around our necks?
Oh, how rotten your pre-apocalypse is
All you Bible-black fools living over nightmare ground
I see all those empty cradles and wonder
If man will ever change
I, too, wish to be a decent man-boy
But all I am is smoke and mirrors
Still given everything, may I be deserving
And there forever remains that change from G to Em"

To merge into the stars

You look up long enough to notice

And well-timed time that I'll spend alone
Throw my body into insignificant positions
I'm gonna make more starts
Complete more chances and more finishes
Fly through the world like a whirling dervish in a hurricane
Take off my clothes and run screaming in the pouring rain
Kiss people even when I'm pretty sure it's a mistake
And try to find a love that not for a second I'll have to fake

Dark rolls in and it starts to rain
Starin' out to the cage-like walls
Time goes by and the shadows crawl
Crushin' candy, crushin' pills
Got no job, mom pays my bills
Textin' exes, get my fill
Sweatin' bullets, Netflix chills
World's out there singin' the blues
Twenty more dead on the evening news
Think to myself, ""Really, what's the use?""
I'm just like you, I was born to lose

Why, oh, why can't you just fix me?
When all I want's to feel numb
But the medication's all gone
Why, oh, why does God hate me?
When all I want's to get high
And forget this so-called life

I am so frickin' bored
Nothin' to do today
I guess I'll sit around and medicate (Medicate)
I am so frickin' bored
Nothin' to do today
I guess I'll sit around and medicate (Medicate)

Can't wait to feel better than I ever will
Attack that shit like a kid on Benadryl
Chase it down with a hopeful smile
Hate myself, I can go for miles
They say family's all you need
Someone to trust can't help you breathe
Inhale that drug but you start to choke
You fall on the outs of an inside joke

Why, oh, why can't you just fix me?
When all I want's to feel numb
But the medication's all gone
Why, oh, why does God hate me?
'Cause I've seen enough of it, heard enough of it, felt enough of it
Had enough of it!

I am so frickin' bored

I guess I'll sit around and medicate (Medicate)

Superman is a hero
But only when his mind is clear, though
He needs that fix like the rest of us
So he's got no fear when he saves that bus
All the stars in the Hollywood Hills
Snapchat live while they pop them pills
All those flavors of the rainbow
Too bad that shit don't work though

Your friends are high right now
Your parents are high right now
That hot chick's high right now
That cop is high right now
The president's high right now
Your priest is high right now
Everyone's high as fuck right now
And no one's ever coming down!

Chickens on the sink, crack on the stove
Triple beam for the weight, cut the middle man
I'm tryna get 8 white bitches snorting off the plate
Coke from Columbia, riding 'round in the Benz
Looking like a trap star, flipping raw day and night
Tryna get my money right, naw I ain't living right
Fucking bitches all night, kick 'em out the next day
Every day is pay day, hit me with a half, bring it back in two days
Living in Cali by the oceans
Condo got 'em open, long dick stroke 'em
I send 'em to the husband, he over there fussing
I'm over here fucking, no loving
P-P-Puffing on heavenly, rock star, 70s
Slim pants, ripped jeans, Jeremy Scott wings
Bucket hat on lean, counting up cream
Rolling on beans, disobedient with dreams
Tatted from neck to ear, bitches they wanna stare
Macking with hoes as I pose
Hammer in my drawers, Henny out my pores as I pour
Hit the blunt, 200 on the dash as I pass

Got a Eastside nigga that'll leave you on Vernor
Burberry belt, yo bitch wanna unbuckle it
Off of two lines, now she wanna suck on it
IPhone ringing and it's all about a profit
Coke and white bitches, nigga that's the topic
Smoking on them cookies, dropping ashes on the Balmain
Ain't talking 'bout hooping, when she say ball game
Drinking on a Tauca, bitch get naked
Told that ho to suck my dick, she said, ""Give me a second""
The motherfuckin' bruiser put it all in your medula
Hit the poop shooter, shoot it on her soup cooler

Like to sniff white in my Off-White palace
Said she getting married, I love her for her talents
And she love me cause I grind, I grind, I Malice
Sniffing when she wake up, stripping with no makeup
Ecstasy for dinner, I'm a winner, you a pay cut
Skinny white bitches, rich dyke bitches
E'ryday a movie, groupie Lee Spike living
You ain't got no money cause you need white bitches
White S5 with switches, that's big business
Living room filled with women, filthy living
Whipping rental whips in the winter, December, nigga

I put my nose to the straw and tear the condom off
I know I'm kinda off
Human bath salt, with a passport
And a cracker ho that give me what I ask for
It's a party, every bitch here named Molly
'Til crazy ass Gunplay came and TEC-9'd it
Just a thug on drugs, not doing much
So skeed up, man I can't even nut
Got the bitch jaw sore, ho can't even grub
Who got the hoes and the blow? I wanna know, hit me up

Of our city now painted with red
As the stench of defeat emanates through the streets
Is the life we once dreamed of now dead?
But we won’t break, we will fight, we will storm through the night
Enslaved to their game nevermore
With the locks on our cage broken off by the rage
Now it’s time to settle the score

We are the frayed, we are the torn
We are the beaten and the scorned
And now you’ve forced the beast to bare its teeth
We’ll come in droves like animals
Hungry to reclaim our control
As we fight to bite the bitter hand that feeds
We are the frayed
We are the frayed
We are the frayed

Beyond the barricade
Oh, can’t you hear that sound?
The march of tortured souls screaming
“
Burn this place to the ground
”
The pack you played for fools, 
the herd you led astray
Now run the slaughterhouse
, 
welcome to Judgment Day
You’ll pay in blood as your retribution
So let’s gather at the gallows for the execution

We are the frayed, we are the torn
We are the beaten and the scorned
And now you’ve forced the beast to bare its teeth
We’ll come in droves like animals
Hungry to reclaim our control
As we fight to bite the bitter hand that feeds
We are the frayed

And when the new day dawns 
upon our master plan
Just hold your rifles still 
and then wait for my command
We’ll kill like savages
 ‘cause we’re unbreakable
But what did you expect? We’re fucking animals

Though what good is it to find the same sad solution?
Another power hungry biased fucking institution
We took the fort, we stormed the gates
But what kind of crooked paradox did we create?
We took the fort, we stormed the gates
But became the very thing that we hate

We are the frayed, we are the torn
We are the beaten and the scorned
And now you’ve forced the beast to bare its teeth
We’ll come in droves like animals
Hungry to reclaim our control
As we fight to bite the bitter hand that feeds

Noises of old rats set to gnaw through me
Blinded by their shadows, and deafened by their screams
The dead of night wages war inside of me

Darkness is only the space between the light
This pain only remains if you don’t face the fight

I will overthrow all the negativity
Break through the walls that hold you down
Overthrow all that is consuming me
Face your fears they don't control you now

There's a beast born in every man when lead leaves the chamber from the weapon in hand
All the rage is boiling in your blood
If you pray for the rain, you have to deal with the flood
Waves of my regret vow to consume me
I’ll never forget the pain that ran through me
Wade through the wreckage and learn to reject it
I’m the survivor, no longer infected

Darkness is only the space between the light

Trying to fight for a new moral low ground
I see the parallels when the sinners are holding the arrows

No feeling left, still we're dying to know
But that's the price that you pay for your sorrow

One love for your enemy
Two steps from the edge of your sanity
Three strikes for the cavalry
You cut me close to the bone
Four walls that you'll never see
Five waits for a taste of humanity
Six feet, what a travesty
You cut me close to the bone

Why don't you stick around?
It's just a game but we live on the edge of the seat
We like that and we ain't easy to talk 'round
We feel the dagger twist when we're faced with the straight and the narrow

No feeling left, still we're dying to know
But that's the price that you pay for your sorrow

One love for your enemy
Two steps from the edge of your sanity
Three strikes for the cavalry
You cut me close to the bone
Four walls that you'll never see
Five waits for a taste of humanity
Six feet, what a travesty
You cut me close to the bone

You cut me close to the bone
Grit grinding under my teeth
I guess that I can stop if I'm getting you down
I'll keep myself on a leash
If I were born to hang then I'll never be drowned
(I'll never be drowned)
(Grit grinding under my teeth)

As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper

It was on its way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never looked like yourself from the side
But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne
With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you'd never lost a war
And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

And I don’t give a fuck when I walk into battle
And thats why I got all the power
I’m where you wanna be
Ain’t no one ahead of me
All of my enemies made a decision
It's better to follow me
I make no apologies
All of my sins I would repeat and I repeat
Cause I'ma be me 'til the death of me, oh yeah

I can smell your fear
The only reason that I’m here
Is to wreak havoc
Everybody prayin' that I’ll change, yeah
Maybe one day but tomorrow I’ll be back at it
Cause bad habits they die hard
We live fast we die hard
Go against me you’ll die hard
Die hard

I dine with the blood on my hands
Thrive when I’m beatin' the man
All I learned in the pen
Is never get caught
Just get out and hit it again
Straight outta context
Ain't see me come like it's phone sex
Ain't hear me tick like a Rolex
Cause I’m keepin' a nuclear conscience
I fly like an atom bomb
In a world riddled with conflict
Hate that you need me
Wanna destroy me but you can’t
You're gonna deploy me in the end

Maybe I’m just too bad
To remember how good it feels

'bout a thing that I saw
One night wandering in the Everglades
I'd one drink, but no more
I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
Gazing up at the stars
Not aware of a presence so near to me
Watching my every move

Feeling scared, and I fell to my knees
As something rushed me from the trees
Took me to an unholy place
And that is where I fell from grace
Then they summoned me over to join in with them
To the dance of the dead
Into the circle of fire, I followed them
Into the middle, I was led

As if time had stopped still, I was numb with fear
But still, I wanted to go
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
As I walked onto the coals
Then I felt I was in a trance
And my spirit was lifted from me
And if only someone had the chance
To witness what happened to me

And I danced, and I pranced, and I sang with them
All had death in their eyes
Lifeless figures; they were undead, all of them
They had ascended from hell


As I danced with the dead, my free spirit
Was laughing and howling down at me
Below, my undead body
Just danced the circle of death
Until the time came to reunite us both
My spirit came back down to me
I didn't know if I was alive or dead
As the others all joined in with me

By luck, then a skirmish started
And took the attention away from me
When they took their gaze from me
Was the moment that I fled
I ran like hell, faster than the wind
But behind I did not glance
One thing that I did not dare
Was to look just straight ahead



When you know that your time has come around
You know you'll be prepared for it
Say your last goodbyes to everyone
And drink and say a prayer for it


When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams, to go dancing with the dead
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams, to go dancing with the dead

To this day, I guess I'll never know
Just why they let me go
But I'll never go dancing no more
Till I dance with the dead"

Sage and Hokage and child of prophecy, watch what I do like it's not even hard
I do it non stop, when I'm unlocked, got the Chakra flow, no shackles
Sasuke's run off, but the job's done when I hit em hard like a Yaoi paddle

Of medical homage, but if it's not possible, Chakra control to hop over obstacles
To be honest I'm on a roll like honor roll, best student, I'm so masterful
I gots to use my Ninjutsu to get through and ruin Uchiha with a massive blow
I'm like oh wow, they don't know how I be killing pros with my own sound
Take you to the country, if you ain't ready for this rodeo, well it's gon be a hoe down
Go loud, I got so much power within, Byakugou seal, my powers will win
I don't talk trash, no I don't blow smoke, but if I do, then it's gon be a powerful wind
Now look who I'm becoming, the realest and illest woman
Breaking down the competition, Sasori don't even want it

I'm just surviving until the source of my hatred is dying
So I seek the power that I need and this team is confining
Try and read the right-ing on the wall or get left with the lightning
Chidori sounding like the screams of my clan and my culture
Wearing Uchiha on my back and their hate on my shoulders
Now I'm surrounded by these snakes, they're behaving like vultures
And all this vengeance is consuming me over and over
Used to have the strongest vision, now I see darkness and heartache
Living in the shadow of a brother who should've been Kage
The ones I recognised the least are refusing to disregard me
I wanna sever these bonds, so tell me why won't you discard me?

I'll copy your moves like a Facsimile
I'm like an encyclopedia of Jutsu's, that's a fact simile
Can clearly see your next course of action before you step forward
And use your own moves against you like a mirror on a chess board
I'm that Ninja, beating me? That's a silly notion
Throwin' walls up quicker than a brick-laying Mason guarding his emotions

Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before

Our pupils were dilated, we were captivated
Fixated with something that I forget
In some tent
Hunting through our mates' grog, the weather hot
We were doing lines in my car and laughing
At people passing

We watched a band, you whispered in my ear
""I can't bloody wait to watch you here""
Saw your eyes from miles away in a drugged-up haze
Why was it all okay?

Can fingers blush? I swear mine did
When they traced around the edges of your belt
My hands were numb, your breath ragged

4QoYZYRNnU3kDHzGbmZwFP,Epica,Cry for the Moon - Live in Miskolc,0.245,0.891,Q2_Angry,"This is the pre-production for ""Cry for the Moon"", as we recorded it at my place before entering the Excess Studio to record it as a demo track
As you can hear, it contains drums (which I then played on my synthesizer), guitars and synthesizer, and this last one has a funny story to it
Since we only had two days in the studio, we wanted to use all the time we had as efficient as possible, so we came up with the idea of recording all the synthesizer tracks as MIDI tracks on my computer before entering the studio, so we would only have to transfer that to the recording computer at the studio
Okay now, here's the funny thing. Due to some exams, I wasn't able to be present during the mixing process, so when transferring these tracks to the studio recording computer, Coen and Mark, they thought it would be better if they used Mark's synthesizer for that, probably because it had more keys, but this means that all the work I had with editing, programming and finding the right sounds was just useless, because all the tracks were edited specifically to the sounds on my synthesizer and, well, not to Mark's. I do have to admit that back then, I wasn't too pleased with this, but looking back at it now, I can have a laugh out of it as well"

Do you remember when word was bond?
A fleeting promise in the light of the dawn
Barren December under a falling sky
The end of days and a reason to die

Obliteration never looked so divine
Holding your breath for the moment in time

You lived through hell
Now you're trying to die
The skin is healed but you're bleeding inside
Shots fired just to numb the pain
There's no one left to save

Night blind on the shining path
Ghost walking in the aftermath
Hypnotized, 60-cycle hum
The broken cadence of a distant drum
Twenty-one to one, I'm liking the odds
A blood junkie with a lightning rod
A dirty rig and a heavenly nod
And still you wind up nowhere

Obliteration never looked so divine
Holding your breath for the moment in time

You lived through hell
Now you're trying to die
The skin is healed but you're bleeding inside
Shots fired just to numb the pain
There's no one left to save

There's no one left to save
There's no one left to save

You
You chased the dragon, but it followed you home
You
You're lost in fever dreams and broken hope
Lost


Decimation never looked so divine
Promise yourself for the very last time

You lived through hell
Now you're trying to die
The skin is healed but you're bleeding inside
Shots fired just to numb the pain

There's no one left to save
There's no one left
A fever dream
There's no one left to save
Shots forever end the pain
There's no one left to save"

Silent halls and nameless faces

Set my world ablaze

Spit in my face, pushed to the ground
Look what I've become
I've fallen from grace, bloodied and bound
Taking up space, lost and I'm found
Look what I've become

I can hear the snakes, they're winding
Singing songs of pain and sin
There's an anger overflowing
From this empty glass of gin
As the darkness settles in

Not sure if I've survived myself

I am searching
Without vision
For the answers in the dirt
I am waiting
Just for nothing
For the day that I'll be heard
You're the sea in which I'm floating
And I lose myself in you
I am feeling these sensations
I communicate with you
I am looking
Without vision
For a different kind of way
I am thinking
Just for nothing

You're the night so you're the dark side
Of the day you'll never see
You're the past but everlasting
Can you share one day with me?

I'm enclosed within my own thoughts

But I can't forgive myself
I am selfish and not worthy

Serenity is taking over all I am, it gives me peace
And all I see are visions of my destiny
Why should I bleed and pay for others' greed?
We consciously sign our own sentence of death
How can you go on, did you forget
What we have learned from the past?
We can't go on killing ourselves
And with us all the rest
Why can't you see, don't you regret?
Reality is sometimes stranger than fiction

Leave me naked in my clothes with the folks that always usе me

But maybe this is just a game and I nеver knew how to play it

따스하고 깊은 눈 안에 몸 담그고파
I like that 너의 그 길고 긴생머리
올려 묶을 때의 아찔한 목선과 흘러내린 잔머리
서로 같이 어딜 가든 내 핸드백은 니 허리
Yo ma honey
볼 때마다 숨이 막혀 명동 거리처럼
우리의 BGM은 숨소리
내 이름을 불러줄 때의 니 목소리에
잠겨서 난 수영하고파 너를 좀 더 알고파
너란 미지의 숲을 깊이 모험하는 탐험가
너란 존재가 예술이니까
이렇게 매일 난 밤새도록 상상을 해
어차피 내게는 무의미한 꿈이니까

I'm sorry 내 머리가 넘 이성적인가 봐
그래도 언젠가 보면 웃어줘
조금은, 아니, 어쩌면 많이 날 원망하겠지
알아 내 꿈 때문에 널 더 바라보지 못해>서
그럼 내게 하루만 줘, 꿈 속이라도 하루만
현실을 핑계 대며 삼켜야 했던 그 수많은 말
중에서 딱 한 마디만 제대로 할 수 있게
그래 나팔꽃이 필 때 만나, 헤어지자 꽃이 질 때
쉽게 잊혀질 거라 생각 안 했지만
너에게 난 그랬음 좋겟다면 이기적일까
널 위해서라며 아직 난 거짓말하고 있어
넌 내 한가운데 서 있어

하루만 너와 내가 함께할 수 있다면
하루만 너와 내가 손잡을 수 있다면
하루만 너와 내가 함께할 수 있다면
하루만 하루만

너와 내가 하고 있다면, let's go time
24 hours 너와 단둘이
있다면 아침부터 입맞춤해
삐질 수 없는 브런치도 한 입 해
손잡고 너와 햇빛에 몸 담그네
안 끝내, 아름다운 밤중에
너에게 고백해, 조명은 달로 해
이 수많은 일들이 내게 말을 해
단 하루만 있으면 가능해

You could sing those words back at me

Yeah, the doors are at seven and the show starts at eight
A few precious hours in a space of our own

So people think like us
We just want our own space to dance, man
No favours, no fuss

If the roof is on fire, then we're gonna put it out
Forget about your bitching and remember that you're blessed
Because punk is for the kids who never fit in with the rest
Alright
Somebody told me that music with guitars
Was going out of fashion and I had to laugh
This shit wasn't fashionable when I fell in love
If the hipsters move on, why should I give a fuck?

I wanna dance, I wanna dance
I want me some lust, some love, and a smattering of that old time romance
But I'm no good at dancing, and yet I have to do something

I am addicted to American sleeping pills
And every step could be my last one that snaps me in half
I'm in love with everything, except for the past
It will eat you alive, we'll both feel good at the time
To feed something in me that I wish would die
If we continue to talk, you will begin to lie
I am addicted to destruction, I'm the queen of the night

The way you got defensive

The open wounds expose
The importance of our innocence

Be bought or sold

So vivid
Yet at the same time
Were invisible



Savor what you feel and what you see
Things that may not seem important now
But may be tomorrow

Do you remember when
Things seemed so eternal?
Heroes were so real
Their magic frozen in time
The only way to learn
Is be aware and hold on tight

And sink within myself

Open my eyes and make me want to see
Take my hand, pull me out of the dark
Light up my fire with your spark
Cause I'm letting go

I'm taking my own steps into the light
Cause I'm letting go

Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?

But you see, it's not me
It's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fightin'
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head?


Another mother's breakin'
Heart is takin' over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

It's the same old theme
Since nineteen-sixteen
In your head, in your head, they're still fightin'
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'

Man, y'all did it with this one here, y'all
People love to use that quote, ""I'm doin' it for the culture""
But what culture is that that you're talking about?
The one that you claim as a hip-hop artist
But won't do the research on hip-hop history
Or the one where you disrespect, disconnect
And disregard the founding fathers?
But you know what? Whatever it is, it don't even matter
'Cause as long as I'm alive
I'ma show and prove where this culture came from
And what it's really all about
I got you, my nigga, yo, ayo
[Verse 1: Sheek Louch & 
DJ Kay Slay
]
Count to ten and then come in shootin' (Yeah)
Fuck peace, Silverback the new Huey Newton (D-Block)
I feel it, it's in the air, white cop with a stare
New judge in the chair, this shit hittin' the fan (Woo)
But me, I'ma be smart and legalize my shit
And I ain't leavin' the house without that in my hand (Ahh)
And it ain't only the cops, it's niggas on your block (Uh-huh)
That talk like a lil' bitch and act like they your man

Somethin' like Kris Parker, my UZI weigh a ton
Hundred niggas on the track, then you know I'll be the one
To tell niggas to suck cock, run and get a gun
It's old P, new P, prob'ly layin' in the sun
Prob'ly on a P.I., if I call you king
I ain't talkin' 'bout rap, nigga, that status go to B.I
You can fuck around and get burnt like a C.I
More bars than jail, nigga, who tryna get a V.I?

You dealing with stock owners, conversation with stockbrokers
Make a call for coco, smokin' dope from my crop grower
The block know us, kush got a funky sock odor
How could you not notice? I come from that rock culture (Rock)
Star of the squad but they cannot coach (At all)
Louis Vuitton holster, this for my niggas in the cell
And on they wall, they got a Nicki Minaj poster
The talk's over, no drive-by's, we walked over

COB bandana tied to the end of the AR
Iller than they are, rhymes so sick, give 'em the day off
This is the chaos, Nicolas Cage, face off
The Dark Knight, I make it a dark night when I'm gettin' that K off
Better than whoever done it, even officers better run it
With the drum, I got a technique that'll give twelve a hundred
Now the tables turn, to whom it may concern
I used to control more shooters than David Stern
With Lucifer, hater, burn

Yo, I was in the park spray-painting on the platform
Patent leather top ten, Space Invader hats on
Eighty-something, I've been a threat for that long
Where a lot of people get poked up and clapped on
My job really putting on for the city
You get popped like a wheelie for saying some old silly shit
Tell me it'll be safer to say it in Swahili
They be wheeling you away if you say it in South Philly

Look, thirty shots, I'm shootin' to peel his top (Huh?)
When them niggas sending shots, they shootin' to get the spot
That I'm in, nigga (Hahaha)
You know what it is when I spin the block (Uh-huh)
Uppin' this Draco, the witness is still in shock (Brrr!)
Fluffin' a brick of this yayo, I tilt the pot (Whip)
Tuckin' this fifth, you play with me, you getting shot (Boom, boom, boom, boom)
Yeah, niggas still waiting for me to drop (Uh-huh)
I robbed niggas for they base and sold easy rock (Ha)

Fur coats and Magnums
Come through the hall with the big blammers
Bentaygas parked, let me handle this
Jewelry that's flashy, jeans is a thousand, we slick nasty
Pull out a hundred in your housing
Yeah, it's raw lingo in a Kangol
Dutch lit, nuts big as shit, taste the rainbow (Ayo, yo!)
Put your paper up and threaten shit
Or tie something up, send some messages

Ayo, ayo, I used to tell a maid, ""Sunny side up""
Basement, a chainsaw, money tied up
Paper bag over his head, so  let the crocs out
Wave a whole chicken by his legs near the croc's mouth
Sweating bullets in the tip, blow torching his flesh
I seen his face melt, drip gooey shit on his chest
Watch this motherfucker beg for mercy
Shoulda let his wiz suck my dick for that time he jerked me

The soldier I rolls with the coldest clique
Call me prototype, never had a mold to fit
My clothes is dipped, my bros is lit
Only time you been sick is when the COVID hit
Better get in line, I chop the bass like I'm pitching dimes
Code name Coffee Bean how I hit the grind
Precision design, exquisite with the vivid shine
I'm like a European watch on a different time

I used to run around with a MAC-10
Back when I was 20 years old, that was back then (30)
30 clip in the 40, move yayo like 50
Man, I hustle like Nip in the Rolling 60's
I was born in the '70's, grew up in the '80's
Got the MAC-90, then I went crazy
Do the mathematics, y'all can't compete (100)
All by myself, I'm 100 deep

I was on the first 50, now the powers at a dollar
Politician pushing tracks in it, mayor, I president in it
'Til it's humbling, think you grounded and get punished
This the second time Slay needed my two cents to keep it a hundred
How you want it? Fake and be a martyr for this matrix?
They gon turn up the AC then charge you for the blankets
Lux verse mean, got you stuck standing there
Like you at a stop sign waiting for it to turn green, what you mean?

My soul is never for sale
My youngin' just did a twelve, he home, he ringing bells
Wish him well, me and mines on different times
Decline from nigga crimes, I'm fine just spitting rhymes
Read the signs, body language is loud
Cowards hang with the crowd, I ain't never changing my style
Then and now, before that was all that
Fall back, official is what you call that

I be that Third Coast legend, Dirty South icon
Shuttin' shit down, soon as they cut my mic on
From the first bar down to the last syllable
Niggas that thought they were immortal find out they killable
Once I see blood, I'm like a Great White
Catch you slippin' on a late night and it's no bark, straight bite
Watch you bleed out as reality starts to sink in
You tried the Triple OG (Bitch) what was you thinking?

I give the coke to your crew, the butter's crazy
Fallopian tube, just cut it, baby
Gordo butterfly collar cover the Cubans
She need pads like Ewing, I hope you know what you doin' (Look)
Some paid 4-5 serious
I come through, 4-5, serious
Slay got me Shade 45 Sirius
Gold frame shades 45, Siri

I used to be up in a tunnel like a hundred deep
Screamin', ""Nine Trey, Su-Woo"" with a bunch of B's
Never tied up shoes, but every night we would run the streets
Nigga, fuck growlin', it was nights I heard my stomach speak
Then I started pumpin' that bass like they done a beat
Never let shit slide 'cause they might think somethin' sweet
Nigga, it's July, shots get hot like summer heat
When I pop up, niggas turn vegan, they never wanted beef

I know these streets with my eyes closed, so my worst fear is to die slow
Lie low, 'cause in '05 you flipped to Five-O
And I know, 'cause if Alpo did it to Rich
For some bricks, word to Flex, he had no reason to lie, po'
Aight though, we ain't gotta dwell on the past
Devilish laugh, arrow spins I'm ahead of the crash
Better to clash, when you handle your beef, settle it fast
Metal and mask but still keep an elegant class

Who the greatest all time? Where them niggas reside?
I seen all fifty names, man them niggas done lied
I take the first forty-eight, make them niggas retire
Last two we could joust, make them niggas my squad
Fuck them, let's see how the ladies fare
Swerve on these bitches like I'm settin' my baby hair
They feel a type way, but they never gon' take it there
They tryna keep it cute 'cause they know that it's safer there
They wouldn't dare

I can't explain what I dealt with
Know it was all weak and creep and stealth shit
When I come from under the belt with a metal shit
Forever Brownsville, numb, I never felt shit (You're as cold as ice)
I still got that real world charm, nigga, be alarmed
Body armor on, warmer in my palm (NYC)
Where you get the storm before the calm
(M.O.P.) OG and we treat it like Vietnam

My generation drank forty ounces of Old English to ease the pain
Y'all niggas drink White Claws, nigga, we ain't the same (Kahm-kahm)
It's curfew whenever I come through (Kahm-kahm)
Kill the fuckery, them niggas can't fuck with me (Come on!)
I'm really 'bout it in the war
Taxiderm' your bitch head, mount it on the wall (It's M.O.)
Throw it up, nigga, we stand tall (It's M.O.)
You know what the fuck we stand for, it's M.O

Too many niggas in here, but never follow the script
It's movie time, release the clip and have 'em doin' a flip
Off-white Virgil, need a whip with the interior Crip
On any given goal to slide, nigga, minus the slip
Checkin' niggas outta line, like it ain't nothin' to skip
Step in my section trying to flex and end up gettin' you stripped
Too many niggas watered down, might go to sinking they ship
And if it's beef, I come to trip, I never pull up and dip
It's Precious season, nigga

Walkin' in the storm, my face had the hatred in it
Mons had the colorful money with the staples in it
Grew up street and I stay committed (Yeah)
Movin' white back and forth over green like table tennis
Guap was pourin' in, my Glock was roarin'
At nineteen, shots hit you like hydroxychloroquine
I'm still forty with the forty close
In the 840 playin' new E-40 with some horny hoes

(Yeah) Finally, y'all been waiting
To hear a verse for the economy stimulation
With Bible verses forsaken and tribal authorization
We marchin' as we awaken the mobsters across the nation
Ask doubles next to ride
The show gun with Shogun to testify
Fasho son, we hold somethin' that electrifies
N-1 L-B, no one left behind, pause it

Where I grew up in the world of Pop to give you the shot
When I vodka, the Glocka blocka! and blew the dot
You want attention? I'll give you the spot
And run up on your favorite artist aimin' at him, like, ""Do the drop""
I smack the cobble out a gobblin' blogger
Togglin' robbers with my saliva as hot as a pot of lava
And guapa, my mob has been on the sly since Yo Gabba Gabba
Trying to get the drop guava, interior baklava

Straight out the Bronx, straight off the fall
Straight off the motherfucking claw for who's settin' it off
Blocks where they spark a lot, click with the Glock a lot
Catch you at the parking lot, park you in your parking spot
Niggas know it's sex money, flex money, they do a lot
What's better than more letters and buddha spots?
Buck fifties for niggas that don't do a lot
Go ahead and get your shooter, get your shooter shot

Shaq Dies', front if you want
Flow through the spirit of Kobe, I don't puff on no blunts
My estate got a shuttle, you punks
Funny thing I got places in my place I ain't discover in months (Months)
I naturally hover above 'em, I'm Kal-El
Touchdown in the arena, the crowd yell
And if they want beef, I'm ringing the cowbell
This crispy cream make 'em ring like they found Mel

Jones, and I don't need no introduction
I'm the best, pound for pound, it's no discussion
Seen some mass destruction, this how I leave niggas area
Me, Shaq and Gunz, nothin' scarier
A nightmare on Elm Street when I hit the booth
A motivational speaker when I spit the truth
Come down to Pensacola if you need some proof
I could mess your smile up like a missin' tooth
Ahead of my time, but still in a league of my own
I tried to quit, but they just won't leave me alone
If you ain't got the right price, stop callin' my phone
M-mister, y'all must've forgot the king of the throne

Aw man! Ayo, Kay!
Ayo, what up, Red Alert?
I don't think they ready for this
Well, they better tool up 'cause I ain't done!

When you hear the shots
I'm not documenting, I'm 2Pac-umenting
I'm one of the Beatles, how I'm whippin' from that Lennon
Bye-bye, hater, real niggas winning
The 4th of July don't tell me I'm independent (Nah!)
I'm killing it, bro, my motive locomotive
Zero to ninety-nine like my Netflix loaded (Get em'!)
Telling your boss Brick City boys is fire
Never mind, half of y'all be talking through the wire

Media slandered me, so that's why I'm slayin' you niggas
Never knew what hit him, got the doctor X-rayin' you niggas
Turned you to a victim, man, I sprinkle some yay' on you niggas
They thinkin' it's drug-related, gotta weigh on you niggas
All on the radio with the beef, got 'em sweatin' like they was Keith
And it's never gonna be peace, I'm shooting up your album release
Baggin' bricks with your niece, come and get you a piece
I'm taking responsibility for the murder increase, it's Buck

Kay wanted me to be one of the buck because I been a buck
Back when a pack of Newports was a buck, I was a young buck
On the corner of Monarch, kids from Far Rock hoppin' over the turnstile
To set up shop up top by the Jamaican spot
My joints have been a bop, from vinyl, cassettes, CD's and streams
On every Martin Luther Boulevard, they payin' homage to the shooter from Queens
Right now you wanna be this cracker from Queens
Fact though, I'm covered from special fleece to my Wallaby Supremes

This one image is unblemished without one gimmick
Your line of scrimmage, I cross it in one sentence
The core writer for those that lost sight
Of the promenade, now heed the words of the poor righteous
That build with mathematics for those whose path is empty
But y'all know math was in me for the past half a century
Now do the knowledge how the real writers do it
'Cause I want the smoke, charcoal, and lighter fluid

Talk shit, but I could back up game
The way you silly motherfuckers on the mic talk the same old same
How you wouldn't hesitate to kill, buck, rack, attack
Ask him if he said to Shan, he said, ""FUCK THAT!""
Bullshit, I'm not the one to get with
Pressure gets so violent, givin' a fuck what I hit
I play your songs like a lullaby that put me to sleep
And I sing it like a pussy that's this deep

KRS is big and scary
I'm that legend, getting cream, legendary
Hear me, I rocked this, shocked this, hip-hop this
I woke and I wake up, these rappers are not this
The hotness, I would knock some of these rappers out
But you can hear they already unconscious
I got this, on the top list, fake, I'm not this
Temple of Hip-Hop, rising to the top, kid

Every verse is a persecution, it's murder music
You get cursed, the room is like army, they get the hearses movin'
Fire shit, you get burned and ruined, it's burnin' fuses
Bunch of designer, heard a human loses, deserve these bruises (Go)
Nobody tellin' me that it could ever be somebody better
I got a vendetta, I mean every word, every letter
Ahead of my time and you know not to ever put me in position
Designed to put these rappers out of commission
All I spit is dope and after this, y'all gon' need intervention
Taking it back to that driving ambition

Look up to Twista how I be killing 'em like I'm in Wimbledon
I make a sweep when I'm doing the murdering
I put the cinnamon up in the pendulum
Minimum damage I would never do, I dead 'em like a barbiturates
Omnivorous with the flow, it don't matter which bar I bit you with
I could reorganize the confusion of a child Pharaoh
Now munch on that food for thought from a piss poor pimp from the ghetto
Hmm, I am approaching so I hope you're using a radar
Causing beautiful chaos in this unusual séance

Itchy trigger finger, watch me finger fuck it, niggas bust and
Squeeze the biscuit, hit him in his English muffin, repercussion
Call the homies, niggas spray the corner, now they fallin'
On the white sheet and bars, drag rappers by they wife beater
Drama King told me ""Drag, go stupid,"" so I'mma go stupid
Made this fitted cap a drop top, almost Mini Couped it
Stick shift, automatic, automatic big clip, round clip
Hit a nigga while I downshift, yeah

It's me again, all I be is when, never if
If you see a lens, it's probably CNN or a gif
I could rat-a-tatter, your brain matter get scattered
And served up on a platter, they call it data, baiting cappers
I'm more like Beta Kappa, I'm great like your great great grandma
And they wanna protect with this Great Lake grammar
It's Rivers, that's why I gotta be called, decide if you fall
Or have to wear a thought or break a side of the law
And fight for yours

We a hundred deep, don't give a fuck 'bout your capacity
They tell me who they favorite, I ain't hatin' but they trash to me
Y'all know this my world so I'ma hold it down like gravity
I'm bitin', that's a casualty, I'm blowin' out your cavities
Keep a pocket rocket for the people pocket watchin'
Pull up with a Glock and cock it, got you beggin' not to pop it
Y'all gotta stop, I want more cash and more fast
I went on a run like I'm all gas from all bad

You're dealing with a locksmith, my mindset is too meticulous
Rhymes melt when I sing like the wings from Kid Icarus
Every rap is indicative, diction is like a diction
I'm ditching that status quo to inhabit flows that I stitched in
You're pitching garbage, each comment is like a gauntlet
A conscious effort to execute rappers that try to test it
Ingest them and exit through my excrement through my intestine
Intestinal fortitude afforded you is what you left with

I don't smoke but stay with a cig like Mary-Kate Olsen
'Cause my patience short as D Brees or DeRozan
I ain't a Fashion Nova model that swallow rappers for follows
Just for mentions on blogs with flaws like it's Apollo
But keep the toolie, pockets blue like Tookie, patience short as Uzi
You a groupie, you a rat like Mickey, you look like a goofy
Out your kufi, yeah, you out your top, thinkin' you gon' move me
You like Sookie, you suck dick for chips, I'm too rich and choosy, bitch

I ain't gotta tell you what I've done, who I am or where I'm from
If you don't know it by now then you just dumb
I ain't got no pistols, inf' beams, choppers or no Dracos
No car, no girlie, beams or no bankrolls
I buy shares, land, LLC's and payrolls
Kuwaiti and Bahraini dinar, gold bouillon
Mutual funds, nigga, fuck a dollar and a peso
I got seven investors that'll invest when I say so

Hey yo, max eight lines, I wrote this spinning a yarn though
Foul mind, the villainous Queens, Lance Feurtado
Mean face Murcielago, over god flows
Salute that, shit on schedule like it's Jumu'ah
I don't do the work, I just stuff bags to pass shooters
Let the foreign skirt, squeeze semi and let it squirt
All the facts, all the chow now, getting rich off of merch
Laser beams, I done turn niggas' Foamposites to red bottoms

Yeah, I'm underrated and I never sold my soul
And I never switched slang to sound Southern when the game changed
Niggas say they real, 'til you see 'em on the real
Then you find out they a bitch ass nigga, just with a record deal
For real, the internet gon' get these niggas killed
Hide behind that keyboard cuz, gon' make some blood spill
Your insecurity gon' make this .45 open up your mind and bring enlightenment
And then you'll have more clarity

If I roll a hundred deep, it's two hundred fists, two hundred feet
At least a hundred guns so every nigga get one a piece
Bitch, I'll piss on the tombstone you underneath
This sick, don't play this shit if your stomach weak
I can stomach beef, I done faced danger
I squeeze like a waist trainer then you will lose stomach meat
I run the streets, so when Cass scheme, that mean
They gotta get shot like a mandatory vaccine

Out of sight, out of mind, 'til I creep up behind
Double barrel shots you out, everything on your mind
Figure that, like the next line you tryna consider
But you careful so you dumb down, you ain't no spitter
Then you post, you got beef, tell me you ain't no hitter
You a tweeter, who mouth flame more than his heater
From the days of the park jams, blowin' the tweeters
Rugged raps with a DJ cut in the meetings

G-G-Get 'em!
Let me give you facts, before CashApp
I was frontin' niggas workin', they was bringing cash back
Before Instagram was selling up instant grams
Connect 'em and I can never fuck with no middle man
Before the fake jewelry and niggas with all the cappin'
40 karats in my Philly, this nigga was all platinum
Huh? You little niggas in the way
This million dollar payday's me and my nigga Kay Slay

It's the West Coastin', New Yorkin', low-ridin', Crip-walkin' nigga
Anyone can get it, masked like the pandemic
Niggas mad I don't pick up, I got multiple phones
Slay took a month to find me, got multiple homes
Pop off, my black talons will bullet your vest
(Gun noises) 300 blackout, fully suppressed
Cut through your cold crew like a saw blade
Then up at Mr. Chow's eatin' sauté

Jersey Journal, where the next signal infernal
And eat chicken with friction before I try 'em, kidnap the colonel
Trigger title, trigger finger, trigger treacherous
Double shots of extortion, exercise to an exorcist
Exercise my freedom, beat 'em when I leave 'em, eat 'em
Even when the odds ain't even, I get even
With Kay Slay, fuck they play, the rebirth and replay
Mr. Slap-Your-Favorite-DJ, this all has changed on eBay
It's Jers'!

Top billing how we Gizmo and Milk shit
Grimy crimies, did all the dirt and the filth with
Yeah, my young buck days was on the real strip
Fillmore Slim shit, straight off a film strip
I ran through more fine women than Wilt did
Superstars, chem fills bitches with some soft and silk lips
Made a killing off of dealing that real fix
Numbers like a pinball wizard, tilly-tilt shit

I'm the product of Frank White
Whoever acting tough gets stage frights
Getting clearer visions of grave sights
So get my cake right, something in the bake and it ain't light
Or something in your face and it ain't life
So don't play with me, Hell gates await
When I come to the 8th, I shoot it faithfully
And tell Mitch to pray for me
Slay with the AK, nigga, that's my speciality
Brooklyn forever, M.A.F.I.A. 'til the death of me

Look, for my next verse I done left Earth
The internet done triple my net worth off a sweatshirt
Expert, I let the TEC's work, your neck chirp
Been a devil, bench press metal, I'm doin' chest work
One of the deepest, see you've been warned
Please believe you're now lookin' at Jesus in human form
I'm Jet Li, respect me like you speakin' to Scooter Braun
The newest legend in the league, I lead with my shootin' arm
It's PAYNE

All you assholes finished, I don't have those limits
You'll get this work in all black, it's a black-owned business
But you cats don't get it, that's why I'm stunting on you newbies
Your father was a super fan, your mother was a groupie
That's why I trip like, ""Who you tryna rap with?""
Sounding nothing like yourself, who you tryna catfish?
Like you bodied that shit, shut your lying ass lips
Do I look like I been playing nigga? Colin Kaepernick, motherfucker

You got the memo, murder game is my M.O. (Fact though)
Lurk the frontline, not from out of the window (No!)
Take a life, then take your jewels for a memento
You make it to the outro, you got to pay for the intro
Like a nympho, ain't fuckin' around, I ain't (I'm not)
Shoota a sure shot, like a D in the paint
Don't need a long stick, just a .38, I'm straight
One dome shot, that's how I show restraint (Shoota!)

They like ""damn, we ain't heard from you in a minute""
Shit get great from my present, see, bitch, I'm gifted
They said it's only right they callin' me cold, see, I'm the sickest
I heard it just like Curse of the Lottery, you hoes is scripted
Don't get it twisted, me and you, what's the difference?
I'm a superstar, you role playin' bitches is pimpin'
Oh, and did I mention, keep me up out your mentions
You bitches ain't soldiers, y'all just be wantin' attention

Hey yo, New York, get the money, Five Boroughs of Death
My dude was called, where's the money, fire, birds and meth (Hey!)
Hood Bunny, Bugs Bunny, Iceberg, and Sweats
First baguettes, Big Stepper learn the steps
Earn respect with connects 'cause my word was kept (Yes!)
Swerve the 'Vette like Sean Paul for more medicine
Fur gon' slip, like I don't spit, burn the blessed
The truth, 2Pac jewels like I serve them wet
Vado!

This homicide was prophesized before I was a toddler's size
Any job nigga, I am overqualified
I'm the kind of nigga whose cloth it be hard to find
Integrity? I put mine over dollar signs
A nigga play me, then he out his mind
As long as my niggas is winnin', I ain't gotta shine
If you can't see I'm a G, then you kinda blind
Die 'fore you disrespect me, nigga, bottom line

Return of the barbaric barbarian bar spitter
Bar 9 bar guns ballin' like Bar Mitzvah
You bar 9, your bars done, I'm Barific
My bars gifted, real rapper, my bars Christmas
Cooked like a bar & grill, I spit these bars in your grill
Homer bluehead keep a mag, I'm Bart Simpson
My bars mention muscle bars, I'm bar benchin'
Ted Danson have a beer and cheer these bars pimpin'

I see these niggas flex as if I ain't one of the best at this
And wonder why I'm attacking the mic like a pessimist
My name should be next to excellence, bless the globe
With the pestilence, like methodin', and put in work like a Mexican
A record for killin' tracks, somethin' like John Gotti
What he have, like 19? I just caught 99 bodies
Slay, I'm sorry, I know this hip-hop camaraderie
But since nobody bodied me, don't accept my apology

Stop chasing props, niggas, top niggas march
By the cops, followed hot blocks, they pop niggas
I ain't one of you niggas, I'm a pair of Gators
You a pair of UGG's, you ugly but you comfortable, nigga
I'm the OG, pre-Cardi nigga, the diamond in the back
Cadillac black, Pretty Ricky, Maserati nigga
The god-body, rock a party nigga
That can socially distance your head from your motherfucking body, nigga

I'm so Bronx, nigga, my middle name is Jonas
BX microphonist, also known as
The Bronx bomber, comma, hip-hop's Barack Obama
Osama, Dalai Lama, either way gon' be some drama
I'm the one even your momma fall for
I'm droppin' the bat and take it first, nigga, ball four
I'm roundin' the bases while niggas trip over they shoelaces
With they screwfaces, mic broke in two places

100 deep, know how we roll
Find where a nigga sleep, blowing out peepholes
Nothing never been sweet but we icy cold
Put a price on niggas' head for that shit you said
Got back so we boomerang, watch what you say
Hot shit'll spray, in a box you will lay
Know the Mobb be the gang with the Drama King
Always gonna hold it down, that's what I promised P

I did it, y'all forgot, I'm still with the scripture
Every bar has a plot and these lines are configurate
The mind over mine over mind over the pendant
I am signing on the plot, I will put 'em in the blender
A dope spitter with a pro-black agenda
Supported by the black referendum
And this only a sliver of the splendor
Homie, it's the sensei
A dope boy with a flow no lo contendere

They told me pussy and paper go together like problems and pistols
I'm a problem to pussies who want to play with my issue
I'm pullin' rappers close, that shit you wrote was half-ass
I'm way past first class, laugh when your hearse pass
I Kill 'em with kindness, King EDI the highest
Me, Noble, Slay, you can see we the flyest
We load the spray, pussy niggas retire
100 deep, now you can watch us rise up

When 'Rock the Bells' dropped, I was locked into hip hop
Fresh off the porch with my brother Sean's boom box
Around the same time when I heard Illmatic
I was on my block, sellin' long dimes to the addicts, yeah
I remember back when Rae dropped the purple tape
We was young Outlawz, tryna raise the murder rate
Me against the world when I first heard Doggystyle
Still screamin' ""Fuck the world, doggystyle""

No more mumble rap, back to that Boom Bap
No cap, I'm in the trap where the goons at
Peace to all my niggas up top, getting them lunes back
Salute to the brother of me and my nigga Loon back
Harlem World's finest, let's be honest
You don't gotta give me dap, nigga, just pay homage
Peep my steps, always keep the piece on deck
I'm from the danger zone where we handle beef by death, nigga

Everybody's an opp, plenty bodies'll drop
Slay hit me up, told me body the block
Go ape the whole eight, no way they hold weight
They so fake, okay? I won't play, ya don't say?
Kay shit, basic when they spit
Face it, we not only the zone, we the matrix
Your algorithm rhythm off balance
I'm 'bout to start the ""We don't care if you die"" challange

Live from the Wire but I reside in the A
You admire the attire, I am sighin' today
No Jaden but I'm Lord Raiden
Show you with all the cadence
Lightning in my tips, with these scripts, I'm full paid in
And what a great game in Heaven, boosted my cranium
Bars became za induced with titanium
Stars beyond Mars, the truth, I'm so empty
With six spliffs in the booth, it hits like Vibranium

Ayo, Kay Slay, we can't let the BS slide
The game ain't been the same since DS died
Got five niggas jumping out the GS5
Will leave my gun smoking like a PS5
DS5 the street rap, somebody tell me where the streets at
This that shit to make the heat clap
From my niggas selling cheap packs
Them niggas keep straps, the Onyx is the kings of that street rap

It is Sticky, don't make me put my hands on you
Nigga, I could tell you what each one of my fingers do
My pinky finger, that's with the pink ring at
And my ring finger, never put a ring on that
And my middle finger? That's how I feel about that
I use my index finger to make that thing clap
And my thumb, I ain't got a use for that
So I put it in a bitch ass while I fuck her from the back

What you lames claim is relevant ain't
The culture's five elements, felons pistol whip your pelican vapes
I shoulda named the metal Beretta the Drake
Givin' em back to back hits 'til your skeleton breaks
Yo, take a new era super head in my Wraith
Givin' me fitted, call it the 7 and 1-8
Each one of my bars smoke ya whole 16
How you trap in your mom's necklace and wear big jeans?

I ace the motherfuckin' track like a pro's supposed to
I'm blowin' up in this bitch, you know, Apollonia
And anytime I did a rhyme, I did it for the culture
The doctor said I need a culture, I might have the 'rona
I beat the shit and now I'm like a hundred times stronger
Run for the block and flippin' rocks to a stock holder
Hold my composure, bring my hand up when the shots over
A hundred deep with the soldiers, and we shoulder to shoulder

Yo, I live a DJ's dream, hearin' fans scream
Cash in my hand green, they wanted to ban me
'Cause most of it was tax free, at last, me and Slay connect
Niggas know the outcome
We got mixtapes with features better than your album
Bounce Master with the Street Sweeper
For you heat seekers and them double D cup ladies and IG divas
My mixtape gave your boyfriend power
Holla at me when y'all got my flowers (Bounce)

I'm Junior Reid, I run these streets
Killin' all these hip-hop beat
Hey, I just can't be defeat
One blood family, we came here to eat
Murder!
When I roll, you know I roll deep
My hand stay strong and you know we don't cheat
Trap for the money and you know we don't sleep

If it's beef and we don't make up after talkin'
It's a high chance you gon' be wearing makeup in the coffin
I think of Busta Rhymes the way that the cops flamin' us
Like ""put your hands where I can see before it get dangerous""
Fuck twelve and whoever gave 'em information
State property parties, you want a invitation?
You don't wanna do that, family
Them people gon' have to move your family, it ain't a movie, y'all

You woke up a sleeping giant, there's no one breathing this fire
It's me, I'm known globally mostly for being violent
I'm closing up both of your eyelids 'cause no one seeing me rhyming
Fuck quarantine, I'm outside, I'm a morbid beast on the mic
These are more than schemes that I'm writing
It's for the fiends and the piper
New cocoa leaf, it ain't Pyrex, hoping that they don't die next
Shoutout to Street Sweeper, I breathe ether, my team G'd up
The streets need us like cheap heaters and clean sneakers

Wais P, you should have gave me the whole song (Why?)
'Cause I'm doper than the shit Demi Lovato overdosed on
Put a hoe on every corner you post on, poison potion
Give you my life on every track that I spoke on
Blow bullets 'til the barrel is hot enough to cook coke on
Phasers photon, never on stun, give you the whole drum
Wanna know why I'm on the second run? I go dumb
Plus a hundred rounds beats fifty in any gun

I can spot the lies in they lines, what lines in they eyes
Is fear, you hear? A coward cries when he dies
I was down, now I'm up, they surprised by my rise
I've been out, fresh fade, bitches thought that I was Nas
Lord, please forgive me, I'm a sinner
Sweat suits, gold ropes swinging like a '80's dope dealer
Trust me, I get iller, underneath the chinchilla
The Street Sweeper, Kay Slay with a hundred killers

Always been disrespectful, never been polite
Slay got me on the record with a bunch of niggas I don't like (I really don't though)
Them niggas corny, and their verses is not hard
Probably like ten rappers on this record that I got robbed
I'm the truth, I'm just realizing my worth
Niggas gon' turn this shit off after they hear my verse (I don't blame 'em)
And fuck whoever feel disrespected
Niggas gon' be mad Kay Slay put me on this record (Ah)

The best ever, bulletproof, the vest leather
Head shot, talkin' big bags of cheddar
Harlem, we run shit, you fags sleep
Cemetery, last stop, your bag's deep
Six feet, gun and a mask, my team creep
Mausoleum, you can see 'em, your team's sleep
Harlem, mob style, we run shit
Sheet rock, bury niggas for dumb shit

Grenades, bombs and rocket launchers
The smell of dead bodies, the odor comes back to haunt ya
Gucci vests from Dapper Dan, mountains of blow on a glass table
Look like a goddamn avalanche
Construction bags of snow, one scale
One doctor just in case your blood pressure fail
We got diesel, weed, coke and lean by the pail
Two phones next to that old bitch out in Wales

Show a sign, force on the course, it's authentic
You cross the sauce, try to be boss, get lost in it
That's a early retirement, call it a forced finish
Fuck a Porsche with horse, I put your horse with Porsche in it
Nigga, Mike Cee, syllable, syllabicate
Syllabicate, it's so real, realize, realization
Realization, realize, real
S-Syllabicate, s-syllabicate, syllables, Mike Cee

I swear to God if I die tonight, I'm taking a few niggas with me
My little man just came home doing 5 so I gave him 50
I ain't gave his Dior back meaning I got this Llama with me
Run Scott my papers 50 sellin' bricks, I don't fuck with dizzies
Keep a lot of shooters outside, it's gon' be hard to clip me
Before I surrender to God and Mississippi
Got these bitches being my mule to get some bigger titties
Falling cost me 260, got another 60 with me

Fuck y'all, thought I better talk, caught up a narrative
I sat back watching you tryna figure what bag it is
Imagine if I came back, Super Lover with savages
And put a tilting was building change the average of marriages
'Cause she's still after me due to audio in audacity
For cardio and the tune grooving room at capacity
When parties over, we boom boom, for you it's gravity
A tragedy, by two masterpieces causing catastrophe

You could have a hundred verses from my hundred persons
But this one emerges
And it's curtains when you get to squirting on a piece of Birkin
Detroit is a mindset, as soon as the verse ends, you rewind it
Knowing that the Drama King was behind it
I'm Page Kennedy, don't let the last man escape
Get your ass kicked by a movie star that looks more like an asterisk
Get your bifocal lens
You a fighter that wouldn't even punch vocals in

I spit stupid, you just stupid
Don't even walk off your porch, you should just stoop it
You too bitch for this goon shit, it ain't just music
We shoot you and jam to your death, no Rick Rubin
Yo, my gun blow drumroll, 'til it unload
Or 'til the gun broke, then punch holes through a chump's soul
I'm muggin', it's just jokes, I'm friendly and shit
Get higher, it's the highway to Heaven, I'll send you a lift

(Gunplay) 7.62's, nigga never left clues
Crib looking like a motherfuckin' evidence room
And I keep a street sweeper, nothing less than this broom
And that's only when I'm in a fuckin' excellent mood
I got four nine-pieces on a four-door panel
Louis open-toed sandals, overdose on those samples
Living legend in the 'jects, nigga daddy every threat
Homie died in his holster, got the weapon, never left

The pandemic got niggas searching for endemic
You either win or you a dub, fuck the club, don't get it fucked up
It's still paid for the bin
And you just gotta find a fucking way in
Now we gonna see who's a boss
And rise above the COVID or take a fucking loss
Wear the mask or don't, I don't give a fuck
I'ma still get a buck and a gold medal, I will never settle

I be the block (dynamite) so hit the sheets to the streets
Like playing games with Jamar's will beat your feet
I'ma drop a straight 8 for my nigga Kay's beat
We go back like Fat Jack, my nigga, Harlem heat
Got bodies for a throttle smashing King Midas
Put the drip in the game, drop jewels and pop bottles
I'm valedictorian, ask any historian
I'm back from streets, you pullin' up in that DeLorean

I'ma keep the knowledge, yeah, two cyphers
(Keep it a hundred) Lord J and Kay Slay, that's two triflers
We roll deep when we hold heat
Stay away or get sprayed with a new virus
They manufactured a new crisis
With plans to capture your third iris
I stand with the stature of the bird ibis
I'm like Dawoodi when I'm doing my duty (Facts)

I'm from where Big and Hov' came, Pop Smoke cocaine
Rope slayin' over coats and them dope rope chains
Bed-Stuy Veteran fella been ridin'
Better than I've ever been America's bidin'
Harris no comparison since
So don't let that fly shit go to your head like Mike Pence
I got seniority, Francis Sorority
Sonja Blade, bitch, just respect my authority

Let's take it back to the essence where it all began (Yeah)
Hip-hop, the original man (C'mon)
First emcee ain't my claim to fame
'Cause I been getting money, ain't a damn thing changed
I'm Coke La Rock and I'm still on the scene (Let's go)
The true OG to the culture you're in (Okay)
Bronx legend, respect the crown
And pay homage where it started, we call it the Boogie Down

I'm from the era catching cabs on Broadway
Put 'em on hold, ride around town all day
Way before the Uber and a Lyft it was OJ
Do the kickstep, man, just like Kid Play
We're on the east side like DJ Kay Slay
Smoke your Chronic up, Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre
Sprinkle my man, E-40, he from the Bay
Yo, I say butter man and you say Parkay

Smooth B kick shit Pelé like soccer
You that man in the middle, cockblocker
I been a G, never been a sucker
I don't hide, never scared, not a ducker
Above the Rim like I'm in Harlem at the Rucker
Motherfucker, I'm thorough with this
I ring bells around the world every borough with this

Always had the bands like Coi Leray
So I'm young enough to relate to the YouTubers
Old enough to still date a few cougars
Yet the struggle became a weapon for me
So success became a separate story
But them cheques, got 'em checkered for me
Shit, I'm shooting from Steph' territory
And I get more love than Diddy's license
We rollin' a hundred deep, and I'm the city's nicest

Look, I'm Tommy Egan in the Honda weaving
Leave your mama grieving for the non-believing
On the deacon, Dominican mommy ganja steaming
Bomb with demons that'll take your chain and go to pond to peacing
I quit trapping 'cause my music is dope
You might've saw me in the lane but I'm truly the goat
You try to tell him calm down, bro was doing the most
They left him in the hospital with a tube in his throat

I trap with the guys knowing I'ma capitalize
But slaps I'ma drive to DC those capital rides
Put rappin' aside I got yak and captions to buy
She smashin' up lines so big they look like capital I's
We back in the times so start us here you back in the pines
Snap but I'm fine the Henny and the gas intertwine
I smash and I grind got the work stashed with the 9
I'm where they'll put you on a shirt like a fashion design

Yo!
You from the hood Uptown Queens, New York
Save the milk cereal with the fork
Scraped the plate and now get the fuck out my way
We on the grind, yes, I got a lot on my mind
Back in the days, I used to wanna punch them in face
I changed my ways and now I just wanna get paid
Smoking haze out a trombone; Nicholas Cage
Fire tire is burning, times is turning

Kaflow Kaboom rolling a hundred deep
Ever since a young wolf, I always hunted sheep
I already killed all the wolves that wanted beef
Seen a nigga brains on the floor and it made ya stomach weak
I'm from the streets where they brag about puttin' you underneath
A lot of niggas gon' get shot before the summer reach
Take you to the balcony, hang you from your feet
My office hours are from nine to five, not from one to three

A living legend like Slay on The Box
The big dime baby, I'm like Jay to the opps
Purple Coogi Purple Tape, I'm like Rae to the opps
When it's time it ain't the mink then I'm playin' the fox
I'm sorry, king of these Pradas and not Adidas
NDF, we the mob and I'm the leader, free the opps
Fear the law, get money, and flee the cops
Fuck the judge, fuck the feds 'cause they the opps

Sickening, street smart but the flow ignorant
Henchmen, but never wear no Jimmy when I'm hittin' it
Big up to the game, bookstores, no more memberships
Shout out to the cub and Dior, free the innocent
Outlaw, live by often, I would die for
I get all the blame, someone get shot, they say it's my fault
So when they talk, I just pay 'em, never mind
'Cause when I spot 'em, I'ma dot 'em like the letter I

I'm Toussaint Louverture, unfamiliar? Google more
Gurkha out the humidor, wise man who fool 'em all
Prove 'em wrong, told Kay Slay I would do the song
Move along if you ain't about that communion, dawg
Through the fog and darkness, the world be in peril
'Til we expel the devils and renew the godly process
I'm blessed, not pressed but I'm vexed, the game culture
Brothers obeyin' other suckers who ain't of us
We reppin' that red, black and green, that's a thing
Like Pythagorean themes that put data in the machines
The latter means I saw a lot, Earth a tourist spot
Still we universal beings, this rehearsal VN
P.S., we turn T-shirts to tuxedos
With flowers from the mall with no GMO's or cheat codes
The power is in lovin' the death of your own ego
O.E. go, that's that Brooklyn

Who really the best rapper since Pun ain't here?
Y'all know the answer to that when Bamz in here
The most underrated, the most hated, the most doing the most
The most almost famous, the most favorite
Bodega getting them chips again, what happened?
First class back from Switzerland, no capping
I'm the voice they wanna silence, who said it's late?
It's perfect timing
Load up the UZI, headshot, take the diamond

In the car with 2 blicks, them shits got 3 attempts on it
You gon' be the first full body
Toe tag, zip 'em up, the doc won't stitch 'em up
Sucka ass niggas been lollipops
Spin the block twice won't leave 'til a body drop
My influence in the hood is impeccable
Stir fry something turn a nigga to a vegetable
*gunshot sounds*
Hello!

It's P dot T dot K, nigga
I'm back looking for drama, I'm here to slay niggas
NYC tryna be A niggas
Blatant only way you figured out to get paid, nigga
And let them niggas have they own style
And act like you niggas really from home
You know that where they shit was grown
And leave that drill shit alone too
Before the shot gets to drilling you
Nigga!

These rappers hoein' now, doin' anything to get papes
Even my DM's like a bitch to do a mixtape
I be killin' shit, I need a sponsorship from Ruger
Been ahead of my time, it's like I rhyme from the future
If niggas want trouble, homie, the trouble suit us
Ran up on you snakes, got me feeling like Medusa
They say they from the Bay, I'm nowhere specific
But those that don't know, nigga, it's a difference

It's getting real hard to eat, no time to argue
Blow a driveway through your chest, let it park you
The broads done rip apart you
Sunset dark you, leave you hard to recharge, it'll restart you
No cinema like our own theatre scarier
Big Dubez, King Kirk, Brando, three of the thieves
Period, lyricists, storytellin'
Cordelen, split your fuckin' watermelon

4D! I go up top, they take enough shots (Enough shots)
Now I'm home, we see what's up then (Home now)
Let you tell it, you Teddy Bruckshot
All I'm hearing is Teddy Ruxpin
Trust and believe, sleep on the D's
Get tough then, mics, I crush them
Causin' disruption, we talkin' a tusslin'
Figure four rap, nigga, fuck all the fussin'
End of discussion

I been livin' on the road for the past week (For real)
Makin' more moves than an athlete (Uh-huh)
I'm from the backstreets where they pack heat
I deliver, got more drop offs than a taxi
Hated by the ones who love, shit's weird
I been seein' six figures for like six years
Young boy goin' dumb and he 'bout to go dumber
Two sticks on him, he think he a drummer

A fist up for black people, our lives matter
Like your life, but my life, they won't understand it
Traumatic stress on my hands, this is from being captured
Mutilated like castration, part of them chapters
But this a never ending story, them pages continue
My shade part of that food chain minus the menu
It's deeply rooted in genetics, the past that we've been through
Original Hebrew, got me feelin' it's sacrificial

I got the power I'm putting in, punching the clock like the '99
'89 before that seventy-five
When I was around and I first rhymed
While many searched hard for punchlines
I had some that you cannot find
Had some that you can't rehearse
All I had to do was voice a verse, the Kay Slay show

Fuck chill, I think it's time that people really know
What's real, nobody else get to spin it
I know these haters won't condone, everything I own
Pointed at the throne, and I don't care who's sittin' in it
Bank on that, nobody son trust
After the clashes and the ashes come dust
You came for the fame, you gotta do what one must
But me, I'm only here to eradicate the unjust
Real talk, motherfuckers the worst
They ain't grow into fuck niggas, they were suckers from birth
Rub shoulders and then it's over, you touch 'em you cursed
I can't wait to put love in reverse
The verse woulda been iller if it wasn't for Slay
He said ""'Sau, it's for the culture, not today""
I said ""Cool, and usually you're always right
But just remember, culture vultures ain't always white""

DJ Kay Slay, The Drama King
Rolling 110 Deep
That's right!
It had to be done!
Everything revolves 360°
What comes around goes around
Bring it back to the talent over popularity
Start talkin' to the people
Instead of about the people
Don't test me
You fuck around next time
I do Rolling 200 Deep on you motherfuckers!"

I ask myself over and over and over again
Trapped in my brain
Pull it out from the cracks in my skull

Dotted your signatures with love hearts on every little note

And I always hated the taste of your pushy, drunken, alcoholic, ashtray lips

Singing my heart out for loose change with my acoustic
Spending rainy days indoors trying to turn other people's protest songs into beautiful music
And I'm haunted by the ghosts of my more famous friends

Hold my hands and keep me dear

Then I could hurt you in the end

It took the death of hope to let you go

Can't stop, not until he dies

It's a 3 more miles 'til I hit the river gap
Slippin down the highway sleepin in the back
Got a hand on the wheel and the other on the phone
30 more days 'til I'm comin back home
Now when I was young my papa said son
Don't waste your life waitin for your time to come
The world out there is big and round
And if you wanna find your destiny you got to shake it down
So I got me a job playin music with a band
Workin town to town and a eatin mouth to hand
Livin on the road and lovin when I can
Well I guess that's the life of a travelin mannn
Chorus
Well we pulled into town with some time to spare
The drummer he's a bummer cause he's gonna broke a snare
Over in the corner there's Anne Marie
Well she's the cutest thing that I ever did see
Now here comes Annie she's a boppin cross the floor
Lookin pretty trippy in the hippy dress she wore
Singin come with me daddy , take off a load
Said I'd like to pretty baby but I gotta hit the road
Chorus
Now there's a girl I know in the next little town
She likes to come and see me whenever I'm around
She loves me hard and she leaves me sore
And she kicks me in the head as she throws me out the door
Well I like sugar and I like spice
But I'm a savin up my lovin for a girl that treats me nice
And I ain't much for settlin down
So if she wants to be my baby then she'll have to tag along
Chorus
Well hey there joe why you movin so slow
Put the pedal to the metal come on let's go
Now wait a minute buddy we gotta make a stop
Cause our gas is gettin low and the motor's runnin hot
Well jump down turn around fill 'er up again
Get another cup of coffee and change for a ten
Gotta keep movin hate to slow down cause ridin down the road is the place that I belong
Chorus
Repeat chorus
(3 more miles till I hit the river gap)
I'm a slippin' down the highway, sleepin in the back
(3 more miles till I hit the river gap)
Gonna keep movin forward never lookin back
(3 more miles till I hit the river gap)
I been thinkin bout the last girl talkin bout the next show
(3 more miles till I hit the river gap)
Well I gotta be trippin cause I wanna keep slippin down the highway
Slippin down the highway, trippin down the highway

But it was long ago
Janey was lovely, she was the queen of my nights
There in the darkness with the radio playin' low, and
And the secrets that we shared
The mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control
'Til there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove

And I remember what she said to me
How she swore that it never would end
I remember how she held me, oh, so tight
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then

Against the wind
We were running against the wind
We were young and strong
We were running against the wind

And the years rolled slowly past
And I found myself alone
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
I found myself further and further from my home and I
I guess I lost my way
There were oh, so many roads
I was livin' to run and runnin' to live
Never worried about payin' or even how much I owed

Movin' eight miles a minute for months at a time
Breakin' all of the rules that would bend
I began to find myself searchin'
Searchin' for shelter again and again

Against the wind
Little somethin' against the wind
I found myself seekin' shelter against the wind


Well, those drifters days are past me now
I've got so much more to think about
Deadlines and commitments
What to leave in, what to leave out

Against the wind
I'm still running against the wind
I'm older now but still running against the wind
Well, I'm older now and still running
Against the wind

Against the wind

I'm still running

And what kind of god would serve this?

In a cross fire kind of new reality show
Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack
While they were counting down the ways to stab the brother in the be right back after this
The unavoidable kiss, where the minty fresh death breath is sure to outlast this catastrophe
Dance with me, 'cause if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy

Standing six feet tall, that's a long way to fall

So don't stress the father or you might feel the fury

So check the situation, a raw deal is what we facin'
What's the flavour of the rules they mandate
The climbin' gets hotter as the city gets smarter ( ? )

Half that mill, they straight out to kill

Oo-oo-oo-ooooo-oooo-ooooo-ooooo-oooo

How, how can it be that a love
Carved out of caring, fashioned by fate
Could suffer so hard
From the games played once too often?
But making mistakes
Is a part of life's imperfections
Born of the years
Is it so wrong to be human after all?

Drawn into the stream
Of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams
They can't disguise the truth

That there is something about you
Baby, so right
I wouldn't be without you, baby, tonight

If ever our love was concealed
No one can say that we didn't feel
A million things
And a perfect dream of life
Gone, fragile but free
We remain tender together
Not so in love
It's not so wrong
We're only human after all

These changing years
They add to your confusion
Oh, and you need to hear
The time that told the truth

That there is something about you (something about the way)
Baby, so right (you are so right)
Don't want to be without you (don't want to be without)
Baby, tonight (you here tonight)
Because there's something about you (something about the way)

Och nu rullar hon med någon psykopat, huh?
Men jag är cool för vi hade vår tid
Tror inte att du sagt vad vi gjort i din bil
Men, fuck it, du är safe med mig

Att din mamma en gång älskat mig
Och att din pappa hade skämt med mig
Och alla nätter som jag fängslat dig

Pulled me like an apple, red and ripe
Wasn't very long, you took a bite
And did me wrong, and it serves me right

And I nearly forgot my broken heart

Here we go round again
Again

Every little key unlocks the door
Every little secret has a lie
Try to take a picture of the sun
And it won't help you to see the light

Every little word upon your lips
Makes a little cut where blood pours out
Every little drop of blood, a kiss
That I won't miss, not for anything

And I nearly forgot my broken heart
It's taken me miles away
From the memory of how it broke apart

To a heart in broken little pieces
And you know I need this

Just a 5'9 beautiful tall
With just one look, I was a bad mess
'Cause that long, cool woman had it all

'Cause I'm telling you she knows where it's at""

And everybody started to run
A-jumpin' out of doors and tables
When I heard somebody shootin' a gun

Well, the DA was pumping my left hand
And a-she was a-holding my right
Well, I told her, ""Don't get scared
'Cause you're gonna be spared""
I've gotta be forgiven if I wanna spend my livin'

With a long, cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5'9 beautiful tall
Yeah, with just one look, I was a bad mess
'Cause that long, cool woman had it all

Had it all
Had it all
Had it all
Had it all
Had it all
Ooh

Ah, she had it all

London?

Yeah, we’re gonna be just like the British Invasion- only in reverse

Kiss him and squeeze him tight

Find out what you wanna know

It's there in his kiss

Oh, how about the way he acts?

Oh, no, that's not the way

I've broken my heart so many times, I stopped keeping track
Talk myself in, I talk myself out
I get all worked up, then I let myself down

I tried so very hard not to lose it
I came up with a million excuses
I thought I'd thought of every possibility

And I know some day that it’ll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you, kid, that I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

I might have to wait, I'll never give up
I guess it's half timing and the other half's luck
Wherever you are, whenever it's right
You'll come out of nowhere and into my life

And I know that we can be so amazing
And baby, your love is gonna change me
And now I can see every possibility

And somehow, I know that it'll all turn out

But I won’t need to fight it
We'll get it right and we'll be united

She thinks about the meaning of life
While sitting in her car
In a parking lot under the stars
Now she's grinding her teeth
The streams of tears down her cheeks
A shallow breath of trepidation
Contemplation turns to action
She's getting the hell outta town
Pushing burning questions down
She's getting the hell outta town
Pushing burning questions, burning questions down
Like a vague scratch at the back door
She's chosen to ignore
That just gets louder and louder
Until she can't anymore
Thе fact she will die someday
Is thе intrusive thought she can't escape
But thinks to reinvent herself
Like the classic American dream
She's getting the hell outta town

That's just what you want, huh?
That's just what you want
Walking on the ceiling
Gettin' used to never feeling
You're still having fun, huh?
And I don't trust no one

I won't keep your secrets now
You can't keep my volume down

I'm a buzzkill
Gonna kill your high 'cause I'm pissed off
I think you know why, and you're scared now
'Cause receipts don't lie
Ever since you, ever since you
Fucked up, haven't made a sound
Got me upset now I'm gettin' loud
Better watch me burn this whole place down
Ever since you, ever since you

Know what you did
Don't let it happen again, I pray for the kid
That calls you a friend
You pull them right in, told them their sins
Holy motherfucker, do you have something to say?
'Cause this is the beginning of the price you're gonna pay

I won't keep your secrets now

Odgryzłem łapę o brzasku
Wolność gęstą czerwienią
Pokryła moje kły
Uciekłem ranny
Strach, ból i trzy łapy
W amoku biegnąc
Oprócz krwi spijałem łzy
Wyłem do księżyca
I prosiłem o litość
Kiedy głód i łatwy łup
Przywołał gończe psy
Wilk wolny, wilk kaleka
Miałem trwać, nie uciekać
Karmiłem wilka
Którego psy rozszarpią dziś

A we mnie samym wilki dwa
Oblicze dobra, oblicze zła
Walczą ze sobą nieustannie
Wygrywa ten którego karmię

Uciekałem bez siły
Wilki za plecami wyły
Miałem tylko nadzieję
I otwarte drzwi
Padłem na kolana
I walczyłem do rana
Nie wiedziałem
Że jestem w sobie taki zły
Latami dokarmiałem
Tego, którego nie chciałem
On głęboko zatopił
We mnie swoje kły
Twoja modlitwa
Złapała go w sidła
Teraz jestem wolny
Tak jak ty

A we mnie samym wilki dwa
Oblicze dobra, oblicze zła
Walczą ze sobą nieustannie
Wygrywa ten którego karmię

W budzie skundlone myśli
Ochłapy pragnień w brudzie miski
Rzucone smutną
Jałmużną psu
Karuzela świata pędzi
Zaprasza blaskiem rtęci
I jaskrą zazdrości
Pokrywa wzrok
Wiara i miłość nad wszystko
Reszta to proch, pył i nicość
Wolisz egoizm życia bez granic?
Wygra w tobie ten wilk
Którego nakarmisz

Wygrywa ten którego karmię
Wygrywa ten którego karmię"

If you ever hear a noise in the night
Your body starts to sweat
It shakes and shivers with fright
You go to sleep with your
Mother she hates your guts
She knows that you love her
So she holds you tight
All through the night
Until the broad daylight
And when she doesn't come home
You gotta sleep alone
Then you wet your bed
And I think thats sad
For a girl of 19 thats more than sad
It's OBSCENE!

Your girlfriend's sweet a little 17
She got the layered hair and the flared jeans
You know what that means
She's just a little queen
She shares your London flat
She thinks that London's where it's at
Although it stinks and when it rains you wear your hat
And your plum colored PVC wet-look maxi mac
You tie your ginger hair back in a bun
You're the ugliest creature
UNDER THE SUN!
1, 2... GO!

And you think it's 'bout time that you die
And I agree, so you decide on suicide
You try, but you never quite carry it off
You only want to die in order to show off
And if you think youre gonna bleed all over me
You're even wronger than you'd normally be
And the only thing you wanna see are kitch
The only thing you wanna be is rich

Is where we're dwellin', swell and fat, no sleep
I work fit, and jerks get their hoes sweeped
Under their noses, this bro's quick
To hit blunts and flip once I'm chillin' 'cause my crew's close, kid

I'm posted, most kids accept this as cool
I exit 'cause I'm an exception to the rule (Hell no, I'm out)
I'm steppin' to the cool spots where crews flock
(Yo what's up, how you doin'?)
To snare a dip, or see where the shit that's flam-bee
Plan B not as poppin'
So I got tons of indo and go to the Owen's basement
My ace been fattenin' up tracks
Time to get prolific with the whiz, kid

Greenbacks in stacks, don't even ask who got the fat stacks
We can max pumpin' phat tracks
Exchangin' facts about impacts, 'cause in facts
My freestyle talent overpowers, brothers can't hack it
They lack wit, we got the mack shit
'93 to infinity — kill all that wack shit!

Ha! This is how we chill from '93 'til
This is how we chill from '93 'til
This is how we chill from '93 'til
This is how we chill… from '93 'til
Yeah, this is how we chill from '93 'til (Uh-huh)
This is how we chill from '93 'til
This is how we chill from '93 until
This is how we chill from '93 'til (Yeah)

I be coolin', school's in session, but I'm fresh in
Rappin', so I take time off to never rhyme soft
I'm off on my own shit with my own clique
Roll many back-roads with a fat stoge and blunts, foldin' runts
Holdin' stunts captive with my persona
Plus a bomber, zestin'
Niggas is testin' my patience, but I stay fresh and

Restin' at the mall, attendance on 'noid (Get off!)
But I am shoppin' for my wish to exploit
Some few fits, some new kicks
I often do this, 'cause it's the pits not bein' dipped

Flipped! The flyer attire females desire
Baby, you can step to this if you admire
The extraordinary dapper rapper
Keep tabs on your main squeeze before I tap her

I mack her, attack her with the smoothness
I do this, peepin' what my crew gets, huh! (Shit)
Loot, props, respect and blunts to pass
Crews talk shit, but in my face, they kiss my ass (Smack!)
They bite flows, but we make up new ones
If you're really dope, why ain't you signed yet?
But I get my loot from Jive/Zomba, I'ma bomb ya
You will see, from now to infinity

Ahhh (Yeah), this is how we chill from '93 'til
This is how we chill from '93 'til
Huh! This is how we chill from '93 'til

But, but who's chillin' around the Land, y'know?
Yo, who's chillin'? I think I know who's chillin'
Yeah, tell me who's chillin' then, A-Plus
Casual — you know he's chillin'
Yo! Pep Love — he gotta be chillin'
Jay-Biz — you know he's chillin'
Ayo, man, my — my man Snupe is chillin', man
Yo, Mike G — you know he's here chillin'
Yeah, my man Mike P — you know he gotta chill
Del the Funky Homosapien is chillin'
Aye, aye, my man Domino — yo, he's chillin'
Yeah… and it's like that to the end (Yeah, like that)

Just trying to get along, there's no peace for me
This tattooed tear, it falls forever from my eye
Deep in my heart, this pain and anguish
Forced down, it explodes violence and anger
You get a bitter taste of what it's like to live my life

Let's go!

So now I wander alone without no one
There's just this pain in my heart
There is no place that I can go
And so it's come to be, shards of broken dreams cutting me apart

Thinking of before this path was chosen
A time of great promise that's now been wasted
There is no turning back as regret chokes my soul
In a violent world, hate makes you harder
We all want to be loved but we don't know how
How do you make right that which can never be undone?

So now I wander alone without no one
There's just this pain in my heart
There is no place that I can go

One leader, a thousand slaves
For every throne, there's a thousand graves

You're all the same
Just part of their machine
Perpetuate their dream

They subsidize your nightclubs and they subsidize your malls
They herd and brand the masses within painted prison walls
Until your freedom of assembly becomes the missiles they create
Or just mass delusion, dancing to this music that you fucking hate

But I'm not the same
I'm not part of your fucking machine
I'll jeopardize your dream

I'd rather be imprisoned in a George Orwellian world
Than your pacified society of happy boys and girls
I'd rather know my enemies and let them know the same
Whose windows to smash and whose tires to slash and where to point the fucking blame

LD, aka stem cells

Everybody know the cat like a dope meme
I got em' buzzing off the crack like a dope fiend
They saw 'em come up with a Mac, yeah, I'm so Steve
Nowadays, bitches tryna crack, got 'em ODing
Like, how them hoes want to get it with L?
They know it's cold enough to charge, like a letterman sale
If they gon' stand behind the bars, I'm in federal jail
I'm going far like a general mail
On that note, I got the fellas saying ""What up,"" the tape, what up?
The same motherfucker playing with his steak cut up
I'm great, shut up, the flowing, no debate, just us
I'm out of shape, but I'm straight to fuck
Yeah, you know I got a chicken in the condo
I was sick of getting off beat, she a bongo
Now she playing with the hard D, being Rondo
Drunk and go inside her all sweet like a Strongbow
How I'ma do?
I got your ex coming next like a W do
I gotta flex, I'm the best, now I'm being direct
I'm unimpressed by these bitches that I see in the press
I'm kinda vexed by the trash like I'm cleaning a mess
Cause they as real when they rap as a Chia's a pet
They old news, stocks plummet, men's leg hair, they ain't cut it
Forget about your era, Pat Summitt
Finesse writtens
I wanna get a hundred bitches and fuck with the spitting
Religious like a couple of post-marital Christians
I've been official, Dick Bevetta a living
You better dig it like you bitches got a mill in the ditch
I'm killing this shit I been kicking like a villainous ninja
My shit is gripping when I run it, how the fuck I be slipping?
I be intimate with them hoes, she never flummoxed
I take chick, pee, and smash, I call it hummus
And I be funny with this shit, I'm just playing
But still nobody fucking with the kid, I'm just saying, ah
Got a chicken parm on the date, it seem
But I don't even know the broad, she just grating the cheese
I don't even got a job, I just blaze and free
But still they give a boy bands, 98 Degrees
So come fuck with me
I got a couple hundred bitches doing drugs with me
And I got a couple dozen bitches tryna hug Dicky
And I got a couple bitches who be steady fucking me
Hey, that's a good ass life
Only thing I got left, find a good ass wife
But yo, I gotta hit these hoes first, don't tell Mom
But in a year I'ma bend over Michelle Obama
Bruh, you know I gotta do it while I'm hot
I'm tryna get blew in most states, like Barack
I'm tryna show a boo the last name of the Rock
And put her on D till we O, J Watt
I never hit the scene, when I do, I'm high and wasted
I'm fucking with them jeans, love them bitches high waisted
I run around your team, you a player but I'm Naismith
And I Command V, while you copy, I just paste it, face it
Hotel got 'em puffing on the L, going harder than some hail, you ain't knew it
If everybody had to tell the truth and you had to pick a dude spitting better than your dude, can't do it
Telling me, damn, you got bitches, damn, you got hoes
Damn, you got money, but damn, I got flow
Damn, you got riches, damn, you got clothes
Damn, you got honeys, but damn, I got soul, hold up
This shit I'm making's always tight, it's like a yoga store
They all up in the other boat, it's why I'm overboard
I'm taking time to do it right, it's like a soda pour
Cause we ain't loving all you bitches like we spoken for
Damn, packing the band-wagon, the man cracking
The man  packing the stands, had them clapping they hands
Tagging they Grams, Manhattan was ham
Slapping the fans, playing having the plan
Fans rapping the jams, sagging my pants
You see the type of shit I do on the track?
Hot shit, like I poop in the jacket
Won't mack your bitch, but yo, I'm bout to come and mack your clique
Your whole friend group fucking with Dick (no hetero)
I yawn when I hear these motherfuckers on the radio
They ball all retarded, Cuba Gooding up in radio
I long for the moment I can say that's not debatable
I'm past that, I wonder who appreciate it like a Snapchat
Aflac, duck the dude, I'm going hard for the grind, but I tuck this move
I made war with the rhymes, motherfuck your crew
These bitches going Adolf, tryna fuck this Jew
I'm too nice, like a motherfucker that fell in love with a boo twice
As in double as fuckable as he was and dude tries
To be subtle and get her cuddling
Venting her troubles and getting her truffles
And ending up befuddled when she don't fuck him
And someone tell him, “Listen, you bugging
She never fucking a pedestrian muggle like you
So why all the trouble?” but he rebuttal with
""I think I just love her, so I would shudder at the thought
Of being anything other than nice?"" (I’m that nice)
Peeping like a Porta Potty
It wasn't even deep, dang, shit is still a hobby
It's too bad bitches sleeping on me, threesome
'Cause now these bitches want to help, but he don't need none
I'm all time, like the Wall at the Bank
You've no shot, like you drawing a blank
Honestly, you probably couldn't hang, man, I've been drawing a blank
Giving you lines, while you sitting there and drawing a blank
So go in the rink, chilling like it's dough in the bank
And I’m flowing danker than a grower in Napa
Growing the stankest cannabis
Doing rap and pro-est smacking the hoe-est rappers
And showing the total package, like my flaccid is growing fatter
Samoan cracker, dapper rapper, had to keep going
Yeah, that rap is a wrap, I know you rappers napping, don't know it
There’s a dagger pita pappa, tapping on the window
It’s a real accurate metaphor of what you having in store
And I be snapping, I mean I be splashing on the - pane me your rain
Falling quicker than Aladdin for his dame
Oh, you better than me?

But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead

I was the product of a heated lover
Nobody knew how deep it screwed me
And since my pops never knew me, my family didn't know what to do with me
Was I somebody they despised?
Curious look in their eye as if they wonder if I'm dead or alive
And poor momma can't control me
""Quit tryin' to save my soul, I wanna roll with my homies!""
A tickin' timebomb, can't nobody fade me
Packin' a 380 and fiendin' for Mercedes
Suckers scatter but it don't matter, I'm a cool shot
Punks drop from all the buckshots the fools got
I'm tired of being a nice guy
I've been poor all my life, but don't know quite why

Hopin' that they're aimin' at my chest
Much too young to bite the bullet
Hand on the trigga, I see my life before my eyes each time I pull it
I hope I live to be a man
Must be part of some big plan to keep a brother in the state pen
Counting pennies over the years I'd done stacked many
Proving wrong those who swore I'd wouldn't live till twenty
Now they gotta cope
Since it's the only thing I know, it's difficult to let it go
I'm startin' to lose my hair 'cause I worry
Hustlin' to keep from gettin' buried
But now I gotta move away now
'Cause these suckers love to spray where I lay down
My homie lost his family, he snapped
Shot up half the block to bring 'em back

Gin makes me sin, unable to think clear
Hennessy makes me think my enemy is getting close
Boom-boom-boom! Got me shootin' at a ghost
Some call me crazy but this is what you gave me
Amongst the babies who raised up from the slavery
I sport a vest and hit the sess to kill the stress
Moved out west and I invest in all the best
Those who test will find a bullet in their chest
Put to rest, by a brother who was hopeless
Grow up broke, on the rope of insanity
How many pistols smoking comin' from a broken family?
I'm sick of being tired
Sick of the sirens, bodybags and the guns firin'

With the flash, the moments gone
I gave up all I had for

Deny it, but I am alone

Empty pages haunt me and
I can't move on
The words I never said were wrong
I never needed to feel connected
And now I'm only loved by empty glasses
It's gone on too long
I need to find a way to just move on

Deny it, but I am alone here

I ain't no preacher for I'm full of blasphemy
See you in Hell, boys
See you in Hell, boys
Hey!

Like an angel who'd been dancing with some devils
I'm a bad girl with hope for better days
My laughter is spiced with mischief
I won't toss salt, kiss it up or pray
When you offer pink or blue, I'll take the blackest
When you offer only two, I'll offer three
When you point me in a direction, I'll run backwards
And at the border of utopia, I'll toast to anarchy

'cause fire and rock, I'm coming home to you
Well I'm picking the bones out of my dinner stew
Open up the gates of hell and roll me through
Fire and rock I'm coming home to you

I am a leader but you will not follow me
I ain't no preacher for I'm full of blasphemy
See you in Hell, boys
See you in Hell, boys
Hey!

So you're saying Satan's army is rising up soon
Well, if it is, I'm the secretary of no state
Got riches, rocks and bottles in my tool pouch
My desire is society's jailbait
'cause there's tons of guys a-moping 'bout the work day
Dimes by the dozens, their song weighs a thousand pounds
But there's nothing like a lady with buzz saw!
I just might build your house but I just might tear it down

'cause fire and rock, I'm coming home to you
Well I'm picking the bones out of my dinner stew
Open up the gates of hell and roll me through
Fire and rock I'm coming home to you

I am a leader but you will not follow me
I ain't no preacher for I'm full of blasphemy
See you in Hell, boys
See you in Hell, boys

Yeah bar-keep I will surely have another
To the witches, to the goblins and the trolls
I'll be coming to recruit your rebel children
There ain't no use in locking doors — there's one of me in every home

With mud on my boots and blood on my jeans
I'll take those pretty dresses tear them at the seams
Roll me through the gates of hell, oh please
And I'll be back in your daughter's dreams

I am a leader but you will not follow me
I ain't no preacher for I'm full of blasphemy
See you in Hell, boys  (see you in Hell)
See you in Hell, boys  (see you in Hell)
See you in Hell, boys"

Some sing out loud on the telephone wires

Listen to the top where the little birds sing
On the melodies with the high notes ringing
The hoot owl hollers over everything
And the blackbird disagrees

Singin' in the night time, singing in the day
The little duck quacks, then he's on his way
And the otter hasn't got much to say
And the porcupine talks to himself

All God's creatures got a place in the choir
Some sing low, some sing higher
Some sing out loud on the telephone wires
And some just clap their hands
Or paws, or anything they got now

The dogs and the cats they take up the middle
While the honeybee hums and the cricket fiddles
The donkey brays and the pony neighs
And the old grey badger sighs..

Listen to the bass, it's the one on the bottom
Where the bullfrog croaks and the hippopotamus
Moans and groans with a big t'do
And the old cow just goes moo

All God's creatures got a place in the choir
Some sing low, some sing higher
Some sing out loud on the telephone wires
And some just clap their hands
Or paws, or anything they got now

By the ox and the fox and the grizzly gear
The dopey alligator and the the hawk above
The sly old weasel and the turtle dove

Dile que esta noche vamo' a celebrar
Que yo llevo los whiskey, los phillie
Que de todo eso me voy a encargar
Que él se preocupe del mambo
De lo demás yo me encargo
Los jarabes yo los traigo
Que sólo avise si le falta algo

Como un árabe, mueve tus caderas
Es tu jarabe el que me envenena
Hoy escápate con todas tus nenas
Vámonos pa'l party, que hoy día se llena
Como un árabe, mueve tus caderas
Es tu jarabe el que me envenena
Hoy escápate, con todas tus nenas
Vámonos pa'l party, que hoy día se llena

Me lleva en un viaje con un toque de morfina
Tiene cara de mala pero se viste bien fina
Su jarabe es lo que más me fascina
La imagino con su traje 'e bailarina
Quiere que la toque y que le cumpla fantasías
Que le lleve un phillie, que le escriba poesías
Pero si supiera lo que realmente quería
Lo disfrutaría plenamente todo el día
Solo quiero lean, un poco de weed
Hacerme millonario cuando se pegue este hit
Una casa gigante y un culo 'e Medellín
Dinero pa' mi hija, con eso yo soy feliz
Ella me ataca con su mirada de mala
Pero yo siempre con mi chaleco antibalas
Si supiera lo que esa noche yo le planeaba
Se me hubiera hecho mas fácil esa jugada

(Yeah, Kevin Martes 13)
Que si tomo Lean y lo mezclo con mari
Me eleva a las nubes como tu jarabe
Esta noche tú y yo nos vamos de party
Dile a tus amigas que yo ando en la nave
Que si tomo Lean y lo mezclo con mari
Me eleva a las nubes como tu jarabe
Esta noche tú y yo nos vamos de party
Dile a tus amigas que yo ando en la nave

Nena, cámbiate de ropa
Prende un cripizón y pone estopa
Que nos vamos to's de party con la tropa
Llama a todas tus loca'
Tú pide lo que quieras, yo te lo pago
Mi combi es to'a importá' de Europa
Y no me desconozca'
Abrázame y dame un beso en la boca
Que mis labio' los conocen, pero poca'
Tú sabes que a cualquiera no le toca
Esta noche na' de whisky, na' de vodka
Tenemos champagne y to' servido en copa
En copa pa' la soltera, los vinos todos importa'o de afuera
Ella no es Shakira y mueve las cadera', como si lo fuera
Será la hermana, quizá' la gemela
Tiene un flow de árabe pero es chilena
Mi combo quiere kripy, las babys quieren kush
Tú pide lo que quieras si andas con el rey del punchline
La code, los amberries ni la Sprite
Me llevan a otro mundo como tu jarabe, mai'

Y cuando yo probé tu jarabe
Yo me enamoré de tu jarabe
Me fui pa' otro mundo en un viaje profundo
Del cual ya no quería volver
Y cuando yo probé tu jarabe
Yo me enamoré de tu jarabe
Me fui pa' otro mundo en un viaje profundo

Faster than cruelty could drain it out
I commit crimes and I call them mistakes
Nothing denies like a heart in doubt
This I know! People flow like streams where I bathe
Then drift along to a foreign place
The past like a servant that bends for our sake
Into the lines we tell it to trace

Like how we are wired
Like how we decide
Like how we are taught, like how we are not
Like how we hide ourselves in vain

Laughter in sunshine, laughter in pain
Keeps pace of heart in an honest life
But after the fondness for life is erased
What races on in my soul besides
Rabid mutts that fight and fuck and howl till they faint
They too run on when the moon is lit
Faster than love turns itself into rage
Faster than I attempt to forget

Like how we desire
Like how we embrace
Like how we give up, like how we make love
Like how we taste when we spit away


Like how we are wild
Like how we are pure
Like how we despise, like how we tell lies
Like how we're sure that we're gonna change
That we're gonna change
That we're gonna change"

All the bazaar men by the Nile
They got the money on a bet
Gold crocodiles (Oh-way-oh)
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

They spin around, and they cross the floor

Shift your arm, then you pull it back

Hitchhiking with a monogrammed suitcase
Miles away from any half-useful imaginary highway
I'm a big name in deep space, ask your mates
But golden boy's in bad shape
I found out the hard way that
Here ain't no place for dolls like you and me
Everybody's on a barge
Floating down the endless stream of great TV
1984, 2019

Maybe I was a little too wild in the '70s
Rocket-ship grease down the cracks of my knuckles
Karate bandana, warp speed chic
Hair down to there, impressive moustache
Love came in a bottle with a twist-off cap
Let's all have a swig and do a hot lap

So who you gonna call?
The Martini Police
Baby, that isn't how they look tonight, oh no
It took the light forever to get to your eyes

I just wanted to be one of those ghosts
You thought that you could forget
And then I haunt you via the rear view mirror
On a long drive from the back seat
But it's alright, 'cause you love me
And you recognise that it ain't how it should be
Your eyes are heavy and the weather's getting ugly
So pull over, I know the place
Don't you know an apparition is a cheap date?
What exactly is it you've been drinking these days?
Jukebox in the corner, ""Long Hot Summer""
They've got a film up on the wall and it's dark enough to dance
What do you mean you've never seen 
Blade Runner
?

Oh, maybe I was a little too wild in the '70s
Back down to earth with a lounge singer shimmer
Elevator down to my make-believe residency
From the honeymoon suite
Two shows a day, four nights a week
Easy money

So who you gonna call?

Instead, you're locked up in your paranoia”

Guarantee you wouldn't last another day
Can't decide if you wanna split
But take the ride, and you gotta pay

“You gotta do it slow and steady”
You say, “Can't you dig the heat inside my soul
Or is your heart made of celluloid?”

Something out of the Night of the Living Dead

Como é lindo o bailado debaixo dessa sua saia rodê
Quando roda no bambaquerê fazendo fuzuê

But it's like tryin' tell a stranger 'bout-a rock 'n' roll

If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen, and it'll start with a smile
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tappin', and you can't seem to find
How you got there, so just blow your mind


If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until mornin', 'til there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancin', baby, then you'll see

75pTbAqnw5kKRJ5En420Xt,The Lemonheads,"My Hero, Zero",0.685,0.788,Q1_Happy,"Zero?
Yeah, zero is a wonderful thing. In fact, Zero is my hero!
How can zero be a hero?
Well, there are all kinds of heroes, you know. A man can get to be a hero for a famous battle he fought or by studying very hard and becoming a weightless astronaut
Wow
And then there are heroes of other sorts, like the heroes we know from watching sports
Oh
But a hero doesn't have to be a grown up person, you know a hero can be a very big dog who comes to your rescue or a very little boy who’s smart enough to know what to do. But let me tell you about my favorite hero

My hero, Zero, such a funny little hero
But 'til you came along, we counted on our fingers and toes
Now, you're here to stay, and nobody really knows
How wonderful you are, why we could never reach a star
Without you, Zero, my hero, how wonderful you are

What’s so wonderful about a zero? It's nothing, isn't it?
Sure, it represents nothing alone

But place a zero after one, and you've got yourself a ten
See how important that is?
When you run out of digits, you can start all over again
See how convenient that is?
That's why with only ten digits including zero
You can count as high as you could ever go
Forever, towards infinity
No one ever gets there, but you could try

Ten billion zeros, from the cavemen to the weirdos
Who invented you, they counted on their fingers and toes
Or maybe some sticks and stones (rocks and bones)
Their neighbors' toes?
Yeah yeah, and nobody really knows
How wonderful you are, why we could never reach the star
Without you, Zero, my hero, Zero, how wonderful you are

Place one zero after any number
And you've multiplied that number by ten
See how easy that is?
Place two zeros after any number
And you've multiplied that number by one hundred
See how simple that is?
Place three zeros after any number
And you’ve multiplied that number by one thousand

Et cetera, et cetera, ad infinitum
Ad astra, forever and ever
With Zero, my hero, how wonderful you are"

I'm screaming revenge again
WRONG
I've been wrong for far too long
Been constantly so frustrated
I've moved mountains with less
When I channel my hate to productive
I don't find it hard to impress

Bones in traction
Hands break to hone raw energy
Bold and disastrous
My ears can't hear what you say to me

Hold your mouth for the war
Use it for what it's for
Speak the truth about me
DETERMINED

POSSESSED
I feel a conquering will down inside me
STRENGTH
The strength of many to crush who might stop me
My strength is in number
And my soul lies in every one
The releasing of anger
Can better any medicine under the sun

Bones in traction
Hands break to hone raw energy
Bold and disastrous
My ears can't hear what you say to me

Hold your mouth for the war
Use it for what it's for
Speak the truth about me
DETERMINED


There comes a time within everyone
To close your eyes to what's real

No comprehension to fail
I vacuum the wind for my sail
Can't be the rest, let others waste my time
Owning success is the bottom line
Like a knife into flesh
After life is to death
Pulling and punching the rest of duration
No one can piss on this determination"

When I burnt the backs with the sun through a glass
Did I seal the loss that's become me?
Feeling undone
What have I become?

And became this machine
Thoughtlessness

Twisting and contorting
Memory has shaped me once again
Still feel you on the inside (Inside)
Biting through and stinging
Will I ever forget to remember?

Shadows in the sun
Filter through us
Still wrestle the demons that arrested me as a child
Confession rejected
We grow up
To give up
People step on the cracks for wounds owed paid back
Through the words of surrender
Emptiness

Surrender to the shadows
Haunting inside, bleeding through you
Surrender to the secrets

Open up the inside (Inside)

Everyone dies, Edward Bloom, but your death is glorious. Let me show you
(EDWARD, spoken)
Why would I want to see how I die?
(Witch)
What's your concern?
Are you scared of hearing one thing new?
When you could learn
Something secret that could help you through
In one good turn
I can show you counterfeit from true
Life begins when you know how it ends
And yours is no ordinary life
You become important
You're the bravest man around
You're the kind with virtue
Always finding common ground
You climb each hill in front of you
Without a suffering sound
Compassionate and warm
The calm in any storm
(ENSEMBLE)
So, take a chance
(WITCH)
Let me show you how your days unfold
(ENSEMBLE)
And in advance
(WITCH)
You and me can play the hand you hold
(ENSEMBLE)
Now join the dance
(WITCH)
When you gamble then you get the gold
(ENSEMBLE)
Life begins when you know how it ends
(WITCH)
Don't believe the fairy tales
That say life is a breeze
Every man must face a trial
That brings him to his knees
But let me share a magic truth
A proof of all that thrives
The ones who face their fears
Lead the most interesting lives!
(ENSEMBLE)
Interesting lives
Interesting lives!
(WITCH)
So tell me what you want
(EDWARD)
I want a big life
(WITCH)
And tell me what you see
(EDWARD)
I see a road
(WITCH)
And tell me where it goes
(EDWARD)
In one direction
(WITCH)
So, don't you want to see what's next
What's waiting in the void
You may be disappointed
But you may be overjoyed!
So...
(WITCH and ENSEMBLE)
Don't be sad
Don't be scared
Be alert
Be prepared
Take a breath
Take it slow
Let uncertainty go
When you know
How it ends you begin

When you try

You can fly

And the girls I like, they don't kiss too many boys
Books I read will never be best sellers, yeah
But come on fellas at least we made our choice, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

What do we want? And when do we want it?
And how would we feel if we knew that we were never gonna get it?
And where did we start from? And where are we going?
Can anyone here say with any certainty that they know what they're doing?
Ever feel like an awkward understudy
Thrown into a cast where you just don't get along?
All the crowd and the crew are standing silent staring
And you can't shake the feeling that, somehow, you're doing it wrong
What do we want?

Mum and dad always seemed like they had a plan
Everything fell apart when mum moved on, now dad's a broken man
And all these decisions, they keep getting made
I can't remember making them and nobody wants to explain
We're all awkward understudies wearing comfortable shoes
Getting comfortable with doing it wrong
Missed the dress rehearsals and we had too much to drink before the show but now it's show time so let's sing it out strong
 x2
Be a fan of every band that made you want to move your feet
Fall in love with every person who ever made your heart want to skip a beat
So come on, come on, come on!
What do we want?
We shall not overcome
We shall underwhelm
Hey, hey
Because the lives we lead, may not be so very perfect
And the plans we make may not serve some final purpose
But the hearts we heed, they still beat the way they used to
If you're doing it wrong, well yeah what you gonna do?

4LILQ0tq8SoF29dkAX6RXf,Joe Diffie,Pickup Man,0.843,0.745,Q1_Happy,"Well, I got my first truck when I was three
Drove a hundred thousand miles on my knees
Hauled marbles and rocks and thought twice before
I hauled a Barbie Doll bed for the girl next door
She tried to pay me with a kiss and I began to understand
There's something women like about a pickup man

When I turned sixteen, I saved a few hundred bucks
My first car was a pickup truck
I was cruisin' the town and the first girl I see
Was Bobbie Jo Gentry, the homecomin' queen
She flagged me down and climbed up in the cab
And said, ""I never knew you were a pickup man""

You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe DeVille
I got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made
You know, if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a pickup man

Most Friday nights I can be found
In the bed of my truck on an old chaise lounge
Backed into my spot at the drive-in show
You know, a cargo light gives off a romantic glow
I never have to wait in line at the popcorn stand
'Cause there's something women like about a pickup man

You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe DeVille
I got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made
You know, if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a pickup man

A bucket of rust or a brand-new machine?
Once around the block and you'll know what I mean

You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe DeVille
I got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made
You know, if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams

What the hell's the matter with me
But once you've met me it's too late to see
That I'm not quite what I seem to be
If you see me in the alleys, hiding from the light
If I'm there when you look outside your window at night
You'll know it's me, I'm the Pale Man in Black
It was a close call I tell you, when I died
Escaped from the crematory in the nick of time
It seems like I told someone that it was my will
But once I died I changed my mind
So now I'm back with a vengeance, ready to attack
'Cause once you've turned your back on life there's no turnin' back
Yeah, I'm doomed to be the Pale Man in Black
Cursed, damnated, it's allright with me
What ever's the matter with me

I can't understand at all
I keep going back to our last call
The silence was loud and clear
The poisonous atmosphere
The moment of truth was drawing near
Now my imaginary friend won't talk to me
Can you imagine how that feels?
To be rejected by someone who was not there?
I ought to laugh but the pain is real
I like to remember
Look back on the times we had
How could something good turn out so bad?
It might the help to ease my mind
'Cause right now I'm flying blind
So tell me the truth and I'll be finе
Now my imaginary friend has gone away
And nevеr answers when I call
Now I need them they are nowhere to be found
So were they ever there at all?
Not at all
No, not at all
How could I be so naïve?
To think we were thick as thieves
Caught up in a world of make believe
Of make believe
Since my imaginary friend has disappeared
The awful truth has been revealed
A lifelong friendship vanished in a puff of smoke
I ought to laugh but the pain is real
The pain is real
The pain is real
Pain is real
So real
It's so real

I really gotta hold on

Come back home, we can fight
I can take the blame
And I bet make-up sex makes us feel okay

We were both eighteen and it felt so right

As the cars pass by the liquor store
I deconstruct my thoughts at this piano
And it’s all that I can do to stay
With all the things I didn’t say to you
Before you moved across the country

And from the burning building where I lay
As I watch the stars become the day
The L.A. girls were lacing up their sneakers
They run the boardwalks and the beach
This fishbowl life is all they need
It’s everything I needed, too
Until I heard the news

(I’ll send this message through the speakers)
They told me that you moved
(I’ll cross this country on a frequency)

I am slipping through, I am slipping through
I am slipping into the airwaves
And this is nothing new, you are slipping through
My fingers and into the airwaves
(The static’s where you’ll find me)

From the corner by the studio
The gold-soaked afternoon comes slow
I deconstruct my thoughts and I am walking by
On Third Street, the freak show thrives
Santa Monica’s alive
But Something’s not so right inside
Living with the news

(I’ll send this message through the speakers)
They told me that you moved
(I’ll cross this country on a frequency)

I am slipping through, I am slipping through
I am slipping into the airwaves
(The static’s where you’ll find me)

My fingers and into the airwaves

So hang on, don’t panic
Don’t panic, there simply is no need
It’s gonna be a hard day
It’s gonna be a hard day
Don’t panic, don’t panic

Saw the white light flicker so I wake up in a sweat; code red
Sirens going off 'bout something that I dreamt
Thinking 'bout the shit I never told you that I meant
I can't shake it off, chloroform, peace and rest
But you know all I ever really wanted was a friend

Tell me all your sweet, sweet little lies
All about the dark places you hide
Tell me all your problems, make them mine
Tell me all your sweet, sweet little lies
I wonder if the sun will shine again (Shine again)
If I'll ever see your face again
You know I'd rather die than say goodbye
So tell me all your sweet, sweet little lies

Late night fantasy, it's when I teleport again
I got a spare key, we can and go and play pretend
(We can go and play pretend, yeah)
We can really transcend, no (We can really transcend, yeah)
You and me in an empty room
They can't get in, only room for two
If you play your part and I play mine, too
I'll never take my eyes off you

Tell me all your sweet, sweet little lies
All about the dark places you hide
Tell me all your problems, make them mine
Tell me all your sweet, sweet little lies
I wonder if the sun will shine again
If I'll ever see your face again
You know I'd rather die than say goodbye
So tell me all your sweet, sweet little lies

(Sweet, sweet, tell me all your sweet, sweet little lies)
Tell me all your sweet, sweet, oh no
(Sweet, sweet, tell me all your sweet, sweet little lies)

I love the picture in my head
But I know that it's not real
I live a picture in my head
'Cause I like how it makes me feel

Tell me all your sweet, sweet little lies
All about the dark places you hide
Tell me all your problems, make them mine
Tell me all your sweet, sweet little lies
I wonder if the sun will shine again
If I'll ever see your face again
You know I'd rather die than say goodbye

I assure you, dear lady, there is.​

Mr. Wonka, I teach geography.​

Ah, well in that case, you know all about it!
It really is the most charming story...
(sung)
I was searching the dark green jungle
For a tree called the Theobroma
Like a sweet Margaret Mead
I let my nose lead
To its heavenly chocolate aroma
But the jungle was filled with snozzwangers!
Hornswagglers and wicked wangdoodles!
Who would make you their lunch
As your bones they would crunch
As they boiled your limbs for noodles
But no wretched beast
Would make me their feast
For my sword is as swift as lightning!
One by one they all fell
Though the ooze and the smell
They emitted was twice as frightening
Then from high in the trees
I heard foreign ""Whoopee!""s
Then the source of the sound
Were all there on the ground
Barely up to my knee
They all screamed
""We're all free!""
And the sound of their bliss
It went something like this

(Ai ai!)
Oompa-loompa-loo
(Ca-ca-cao-cao)
Ai ai ai ai!
(Oompa-loompa want it)
Now now now
(Ai ai ai ai!)
Oompa-loompa wanna
(Chew chew chew!)

Gesundheit

Thank you!

A-loompa-loompa-loo!

Oh, did I mention?
They're marvelous dancers!
Well they all dressed me up like a hero
They were breathless
And simply elated
Explanations were sung
In their strange Loompish tongue
Though for you now we'll gladly translate it

The beast hoarded all of our chocolate
Those disgusting vermicious killers
Yes, those monsters all thrived
As we barely survived
On a diet of mashed caterpillars

Through the months and the years
Other dull chocolatiers
Met their fate in the monsters' saliva

Poor Signor Ghirardelli
Now lines monster belly

With Herr Lindt

And Lady Godiva

But your magic machete
Turned beasts to spaghetti
Each hornsnozz and wang
You took down with a bang!
And it's safe now to chow
On the beans called cacao

And to celebrate it
Here's their number one hit!

(Ai ai!)
Oompa-loompa-loo
(Ca-ca-cao-cao)
Ai ai ai ai!
(Oompa-loompa want it)
Now now now
(Ai ai ai ai!)
Oompa-loompa wanna
(Chew chew chew!)

Gesundheit

Thank you!

A-loompa-loompa-loo!

They asked me
""How can we repay you
For bringing beans back to our lives?""
I said, ""If you like this buffet, you
Will simply flip if you see my factory!""
And then an Oompa they called Hoffa
Stepped forth and said
Make us an offa'

I said
""I'll pay you in beans
If you man my machines""
He said

I ain't no schnook
We want beans every break!

I agreed and we shook
With a chocolate shake!

Now we sing and we dance

But they hate wearing pants

We all live in a dorm

And they love to perform!

Every wife is exotic

Though that one's neurotic
The fun won't diminish!
And now, here comes their big finish!

(Ai ai!)
Oompa-loompa-loo
(Ca-ca-cao-cao)
Ai ai ai ai!
(Oompa-loompa want it)
Now now now
(Ai ai ai ai!)
Oompa-loompa wanna

And now thanks to that tree
This ""me""'s now a ""we""

And we're all one big

Checkmate in three moves in your heyday

And get sold on the cheap for someone's satisfaction

In between saying you've seen too much
And saying you've seen it all before

Defeat them with your jump and shoot
Climb Crash Man’s tower, get equipped with his power
The right weapon takes fewer hits, unless you’re using P-bullets
Jump through the boss door, float up across the floor

Come on Wily, I’m at your castle door
I beat your robot masters, but must fight them all once more
I foiled all your plans, you never stood a chance
Now I’ll make you understand

“I hope that someday you’ll no longer have to fight”
“But Wily’s back again, and WHO is this Break Man?”
Woooaah, woaaah-ohhh!

I hope they don’t plan on leaving
I can't trust the things I'm seeing
Dreams don’t end when I stop sleeping
Cartoons jumping out my tv
Wave my hands like can you see me?
Everything just seems so easy
I’ve gone blind but see so clearly

Can we get away from anything that makes us normal?
Can we please escape from anything that makes us normal?
Can we get away from

My mind is floating in the sky
I'm in my house, there’s stars inside
I wish that  there was that something like
These crazy things I can’t describe
The feeling of your touch is like I’m standing on a land mine
The moment that I'm over you is when you wanna spend time
Spend time and spread lies

Can we get away from anything that makes us normal?
Can we please escape from anything that makes us normal?

Gracious Lord, my mega oh mighty!
I know I been slightly, out your path
Feelin' the cold draft,of the bleek winter
Splinters in my soul, I'm out of control
And I know, that I should cut down this drinkin'
Too many late nights and, wayward thinkin'
Compellin' a man to plan to shennanigans
The boy in me out and I got to be the man again
Cause I didn't rhyme to get me rich
But I'm a scally, two two's you'll find I switch
Hurt and pain made me, nothin' came to save me
I walk with disaster, prefer to be plastered
'times my master don't ask me for jack turd
All I owns is my balls and my word
No-body heard'a me, cause I'm a new man
I got this new plan, to get these new grands


People call my name like, it's some kinda game like
I ain't got no fame like, I'm just the same type
Shoutin' out vain lights - ""Move ya lurgy""
I'm far too nervy, observin' this world
Who the? Where the? What the? How the?
Media whores keep, shovellin' powder
It's nothin' to be proud of, but stuff goes on
Perceptions change, wrong's right an' right's wrong
Hoopla-hooblahing, devil keeps snarlin':
""Buy it, buy it.  Sell it, sell it.  More, more, more.""
This could well'a be my, last LP
I've had a good run, I've made a few G's
I've had a bag of fun, I've smoked a few trees
Now I wanna rest my, knobbly knees
All in all I been feelin' the pinch
And those bourgeois blacks have been far from convinced
But, I don't give a damn about UK rap
I'm a UK black makin' UK tracks
And, I got love for everyone of those scenes
And them pigeon-holes were never nothin' to hold me"

A half a cup of water, add some Henny
Let it cook for eight minutes, but you ain't finished
Let it simmer 'til the cranberry pop a little—keep stirring, sip it

그대로 돌아가 수년간
방구석 자리에 박혀있던 트램폴린을 꺼내 드넓은 공터를 뛰놀아
점프 한번이면 그 환희 모두 가질 듯 했던 너와
순수했던 꿈들로 날 수놓아

Just hold me

It’s been a long time since I found someone that made me care
It’s not like I’ve been counting down the days but if you ask me I could tell you how many  therе were

You know in this town a peacе sign just means that you want two more drinks

Summertime has taken a break
And we’re out there drinking cider in the Huddersfield rain
I wasn’t looking for salvation but somehow you restored my faith
And it all just made sense again

So we walked down by the water the sun was shining on her face
And she said with your arm in my arm don’t worry, no don´t worry about a thing

You know the only way we’ll make it out of this town is together my dear

Summertime is taking a break
As I was walking past the graveyard she was calling out my name
I wasn’t looking for salvation but somehow you restored my faith
And it all just made sense again

As the morning broke we watched the boats come in
Wandered to the docks and we just threw our bodies in
And we had nothing but I’d do it all again
As I looked into her brown eyes under the Huddersfield rain

Buy me a drink and let me tell you why I need it

Did I hit the wall before I knew which way to go?

Moana, it's time you knew

The dancers are practicing
They dance to an ancient song

Who needs a new song? This old one's all we need

And, Moana, there's so much to do (Make way)
Don't trip on the taro root, 
that's all you need

We joke and we weave our baskets (Aha!)
The fishermen come back from the sea

I wanna see

Don't walk away

There comes a day
When you're gonna look around

And no one leaves

That's right, we stay
We're safe, and we're well-provided
And when we look to the future, there you are
You'll be okay
In time, you'll learn just as I did

You must find happiness right where you are

I like to dance with the water
The undertow and the waves
The water is mischievous, ha!
I like how it misbehaves
The village may think I'm crazy
Or say that I drift too far
But once you know what you like, well, there you are
You are your father's daughter, stubbornness and pride
Mind what he says, but remember you may hear a voice inside
And if the voice starts to whisper to follow the farthest star
Moana, that voice inside is who you are

We make our nets from the fibers (

The village believes in us (Ha! That's right!)

The village believes (Ha!)

The island gives us what we need

And no one leaves

So here I'll stay
My home, my people beside me
And when I think of tomorrow, 
there we are
I'll lead the way
I'll have my people to guide me

We'll build our future together 
where we are

The city lights are burning too bright
I cut and paste these
Sections of maps into my days
Sunspots, almost feverish
Can you feel me shivering?

I'm clinging to your finest words
I'm draining all the angry glares
All that's building up inside

He just kept saying life is like a box of chocolates

He's Gump, He's Gump
What's in his head?
He's Gump, He's Gump, He's Gump
Is he inbred?

Gump was a big celebrity
He told JFK that he really had to pee
He never feels too dumb because
His mom always told him stupid is as stupid does

He's Gump, He's Gump
He's kinda square
He's Gump, He's Gump, He's Gump
What's with that hair?
Wow

Run, run, run, run, now Forrest
Run, run, run like the wind now
Run, run, run, run, now Forrest
Run, stop!

His buddy Bubba was a shrimp-loving man
His friend with no legs he called Lieutenant Dan
His girlfriend Jenny was kind of a slut
He went to the White House, showed LBJ his butt

He's Gump, He's Gump
He's not too bright
He's Gump, He's Gump, He's Gump

I want them to prosper
Yеah we deal in gold with no coppers
Choppеr flow, they broke with no doctors
Cop the throne and shown them my roster
Pirate King, they want what I offer
Box 'em out, leave a man like Gaimon
Jozu flow how these hands like diamonds
Talk with Kings like Poseidon
Got the power scalers whining 'bout bad writing
Sit down
Acting like Wapol they got big mouths
They ain't even messing with the Kings crown
Newgate to Weevils
They be my sons, but they act like they discount
I got my ships out
Act like they Gin, how they change when they see how we eating
Watch how I'm leading
I stay ahead of the show, how I'm reading
Kuzan, so cold
I'm gon' leave a boy freezing
Malnutrition, how your berries low
Down so bad you need a periscope
I keep a long arm like it's Jerry's coach
Watch this GOAT rise
How the Merry floats

Watch 'em big brother

My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware with one change of gear
Nothin' on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
With the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
Dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent 'til proven guilty
I'ma try to get filthy, purchase a club and start up a realty
For real, G, I'ma fulfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my cream
The first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates, got a crooked eye for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes

Nine-hundred-ninety-nine thou' from bein' rich
But now, I'm all for it

A wiser team for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel, Argentina coke with the nina
Up in the hotel, smokin' on Sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass, yo, the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar

Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing
Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'ing, heard about them old timers OD'ing
Young, early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshipping every word them rope-rocking niggas gave me
The street raised me up giving a fuck
I thought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody
Cut out of class just to smoke blunts and drink noddy
Ain't that funny? Getting put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase, I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel, stressing to pull out of the heat, no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spending, never holding out

The wasted mind
The plastic world
With all the substance sucked out
What’s the point of shoveling coal into a furnace
In a vessel with a tear in the hole
When every forming eyes infected with some pornographic nightmare
Growing, pissing on the ashes of the ones who set the stage

It seems this realization's esoteric
When art's only about a profit
What’s cheap to make and satisfies the rotting mind
When partying and getting laid become the first priorities
Unnoticed goes the cavalcade of tragedy
We’re just waiting for the bomb!


Mainstream music, television, fashion
It’s just a distraction
It’s just a distraction
It’s just a distraction
It’s just a distraction
It’s just a distraction
It’s just a distraction
To keep you from noticing the innocent buried in your front lawn
The fragments of bone beneath the white picket fences
Cue the moral guidelines to fit the current profitable trends
With all the feeling gone, you can barely call it art
The wild ones would never walk into the bullet
But to fit the mold, we would cut our hearts out
Lead the cash cow to the slaughter
We ache for something real


The emptiness tempts me, I feel paranoid
With millions of noises, I still hear its voice
Try to numb it, avoid it
To kill it or poison it
'Till it's destroyed but it still doesn't fill up the void
It always feels like something's missing
But I don't know what it is and I'm stuck in this tunnel vision
While there's millions of children still sick and hunger-stricken
I'm just sitting back and waiting for these fuckin' drugs to kick in
As the plot just thickens, the clock is ticking away
And the cost of living is raised, but not the minimum wage
And I'm so sick of this basement I've been sitting for days in
With a loaded revolver and this abyss that I gaze in
And the chasm gazing back is awful hard to distinguish
From the darkness once the spark inside my heart is extinguished
So I'll relinquish my convictions in the face of resistance, I mean
Dead or alive, it really doesn't make any difference, it seems

It seems this realization's esoteric
When art's only about a profit
What’s cheap to make and satisfies the rotting mind
When partying and getting laid become the first priorities
Unnoticed goes the cavalcade of tragedy
Waiting for the…

It seems this realization's esoteric (Bomb!)

Nothin' special 'bout me, motherfucker!
(I'm just a regular everyday normal guy)
When I go to the clubs I wait in line, motherfucker!
(I'm just a regular everyday normal guy)
I got six hundred dollars in the bank, motherfucker!
(I'm just a regular everyday normal guy)
And my sexual performances are average

I work at customer service for a phone company
I make twelve bucks an hour but that's all I need
I live in a small apartment on a quiet street
I don't go out too much, I like to watch TV
I can't afford a car, I use public transportation
I don't mind, I read 'til I reach my destination
Sometimes a newspaper, sometimes a book
The amount of money I save, the shit is off the hook
And I'm not very good with the women
I'm a pretty shy person and I'm average lookin'
Last time I had sex was in 2003
And I'm ashamed to admit, but it wasn't free

(I'm just a regular everyday normal guy)
I get nervous in social situations, motherfucker!
(I'm just a regular everyday normal guy)
I get constipated once a month, motherfucker!
(I'm just a regular everyday normal guy)
And I make pretty good spaghetti sauce, motherfucker!
(I'm just a regular everyday normal guy)
And I get scared when I go see the dentist

I'm the Pauly Shore of everyday life:
Easily forgettable, and I'm not very liked
I have an 'according to Jim' personality
I'm as entertaining as a fuckin' STD
If you wanna mess with me I think you probably can
Because I am not confident and I'm weak for a man
I'll just roll up in a ball while you kick me in the back
Yeah honestly, I probably won't fight back
And I don't have many friends that would back me up
My friend Steve would, but he doesn't look very tough
(You want some of this, bitch?)
If you rarely get laid put your hands up
If you're not well paid put your hands up
If you got a pet cat put your hands up
And if you got a bad back put your hands up
(I hurt my back two summers ago moving a fridge
And ever since then it's just, not the same
Y'know it, it gets pretty, it gets pretty sore)

(I'm just a regular everyday normal guy)
My parents are really nice people, motherfucker!
(I'm just a regular everyday normal guy)
I'm somewhat afraid of heights, motherfucker!
(I'm just a regular everyday normal guy)
I like the show ""Grey's Anatomy"", motherfucker!
(I'm just a regular everyday normal guy)
And I'm pretty good at makin' paper planes"

But your friends don't push you to grow

Between my pattern seeking paranoid defenses
And my capacity to change
I tried to loosen knots by pulling on them harder:
I didn't give myself no room to breathe
And you can fantasize in time things will work themselves out
Self medicate by running out of town
In neurotic desperation i seek out bodies of water
And learn to cry in total silence

Don't believe how much I've changed
I can't apologize
For the hurt
I'm so sorry
Got lost inside the darkness
I wrote into my story
Maybe our books
Just need a break
Put them back
In their case
Focus on nothin but regrets
And things wish I could erase
Never forever
This couldn't end
I can't wait to hear your laugh
And see you smile again
Keep on killin me
With all your lies
I think about you
Every second that I close my eyes
Keep on killin me
With all your lies
I think about you
Every second that I close my eyes
Every second that
I close my eyes"

If what I do is wrong
For far too long I've been digging up dirt
To find out where I belong
False or true
What would Elvis do?
He goes by the name of the King
But is seen upon as a saint
A pilgrim road to Memphis
Has brought me to heaven's gate
To get through
What would Elvis do?
Would he raise kids to be like you and me
A bole born crooked will never grow a straight tree
If he came down upon us tonight
In his pearly white jumpsuit
Leave your sins back home
And share his secret fruit
If I just knew
What would Elvis do?
Would he raise kids to be like you and me?
A bole born crooked will never grow a straight tree
On a dark night the king came down from heaven
At least he's real, last seen at 7-eleven
He goes by the name of the King
But is seen upon as a saint
A pilgrim road to Memphis
Has brought me to heaven's gate
To get through

In a world full of surprising fireworks
And sudden silence
Shh
Lies on a stranger's bed
The new day breaks like a speeding train or an old friend
Never expected, but never knocking
Holding your own in a battered car
All-night parties, cocktail bars and smile
When the butterfly escapes the killing jar

Sure eyes awake before the dancing is over
Wise or naked in secret Oktober

Free fall on a windy morning shore
Nothing but a fading track of footsteps
Could prove that you'd ever been there
Spoken on a cotton cloud
Like the sound of gunshot taken by the wind
And lost in distant thunder
Racing on a shining plain
And tomorrow, you'll be content to watch
As the lightning plays along the wires, and you'll wonder

Say that I should retreat
That I'm marching to the rhythm

Puts the pain in reverse
No surrender, no illusions
And for better or worse

Even rode my motorcycle in the rain

Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said, ""Take me as I am""
'Cause you might enjoy
Some madness for a while

Now think of all the years you tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say
If I'm crazy, then it's true
That it's all because of you
And you wouldn't want me any other way

Then I learned that recorders are for losers
And guitars get chicks and
Now when I feel like a loser
I take this out and sing ""Wonderwall"" by Oasis
I play mostly covers

I do some original songs too but they're not as well received...

Out of the black? It broke your skin and shook through
Every part of me, every part of you

You made a fool out of me and took the skin off my back running

I've got a gun for a mouth and a bullet with your name on it
But a trigger for a heart bleeding blood from an empty pocket

I never knew why and you didn't care when
It closed every door, and washed away no sin
And I promised you like you promised me
But those vows we made fucked it up for free, yeah

You made a fool out of me and took the skin off my back running

If you hear me and I'm singin' some old lonesome song like this
You'll know I'm not over you, and I am longing for your kiss
Wish that I could linger longer, sit down in some evening shade
But you know I have to ramble, guess that's just the way I'm made

You were on my mind this morning, you wеre on my mind today
We had our good times togеther, we sure had our special way

Things were goin' good, and I was flush and I was fancy fine
Threw it all away on women, whiskey, cards, dice, and wine
I will roll, and I will tumble, I will rise and fall again
Ridin' on this rollercoaster, doesn't ever seem to end

Of a moonlight rendezvous

Find me naked in my virgin misery
Like an unplayed melody
Save me, come close and whisper my true name
And become all soothing rain
Touch me like no one's touched me before
In the deep of a cold heart's core
Love me even if it's going to make a crime

I'm so ergonomic, get the plate tectonic
Going Supersonic like a Mega-Drive
Rip it off, need a ripper doc
I be riding lines, but not written off
Like Becca connecting this chrome into bodies
I'm lighting them up like a city block
When I'm hitting shots, I'm going Supernova
Wired up, got a new persona
And my veins 'boutta lose composure
Bring the stars down, so the moon is closer
I condense the track - the way I'm running off of Phantom power

It ain't hard to get ate by the city of sin
If you hating, you lame, and your block - I'mma spin
Your chest meeting my fists if you come for my kin
Cybernetics giving me the thickest of skin
And my Sandevistan leaving all your shots missing
Try my set? You out of luck
Team ain't your average bunch
Really, we some Cyberpunks
We do not give a fuck
Yellow jacket keeps me snug
This chop be stinging bums
The weight on my back's a ton
The kid who yields to none
In Night City on the run
Main mission - hit the club
Say you keep that Kyubi clutched
Like boy, that shit's a dud
Becca blasts shells through your guts
That's how she gives it up
Lately been down on my luck
Still I yield to none
Yield to none
Without her I come undone
You're all I need, know the eyes of Lucy rest on me

There's a shadow hanging 'round my garden gate
I read between the lines of words you can't disguise
Love has gone away and put these tears in my eyes

Wriggling around in incidents you won't forget

Aimlessly gazing at the faces in the queue

Trained two Hokages, that ranks below me
Though it gets lonely being this OP
If ninja being thinking they'll beat me then show me

Danger when I'm coming in
Handling all my summonings
Leaving these ninjas wondering
Why they bothered to stumble in
It's obvious I'm gonna win
Can you feel all the rumbling
Of chakra I'm outputting?
Your defenses are now crumbling
I tell your defeat like I'm writing these words on a page
I'm in a rage
Master of Wisdom, 'cause this is my vision
So listen, it's why they all call me a Sage (why's that?)
Myoboku's where I meditate
Senjutsu I accumulate, becoming great
And learning new techniques I need to educate
The child of the prophecy, he's gotta be my student
And if I fail my mission he'll become the end of humans
I will be protecting all my students in a heartbeat
Seems to be my fate to be tangled with Uzumakis
Crash like a tsunami, I'm stroger than the Kages

Passing my knowledge to future generations
I be making it through heartache and strife
Dubbed as a Sanin but what does that make me?
Through every failure I'm trying to break free
People through my life have been calling me crazy
Even my closet of friend had betrayed me
So it's my duty to perfect their blows;
Nagato, Minato to Naruto
They call me a hermit, but that's just to cope
It's 'cause I feel like no place to my home
Trapping the Akatsuki I'm going after their leader
Shocked to hear the news that I was actually his teacher
But I'm gonna beat ya 'cause there's no way that I'm weaker
Gathering the intel I'm startin' up the procedure

If I knew this'd be my last battle
I would have done more
I've forced the hand of those I care about
And now I'm done for
And though my bloods on the floor
This message will bring hope
So I'm sorry Naruto
Now this toad has croaked

Teach 'em what they know

Phase one, in which Doris gets her oats

Two of us riding nowhere, spending someone's
Hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving, not arriving
On our way back home

We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

Two of us sending postcards, writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches, lifting latches
On our way back home

We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats, standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere
On our way back home

We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories

We go up and clean our teeth (Very good!)
Then bath & bed, a story's read
We love to hear them all (And they all lived happily ever after, the end)
Then he says goodnight
Turns off the light
He's the bestest Daddy of all

Run it down
Live a life that's underground, a heated love that's not allowed
A Dum Dum Club is inadmissible

Let's make a wish as we enter the lift
'Cause the system's a relative bore
The drummer is leaning without any meaning
Outside of the Club Troubadour
I don't know you and I don't know what's true anymore

Walk it back
Get the knack
Information to unpack, a guitar in a gunny sack
My best move is in the criminal

Let's make a wish as we entеr the lift
'Cause the systеm's a relative bore
The drummer is leaning without any meaning
Outside of the Club Troubadour
I don't know you and I don't know what's true anymore

Let's move like the Tchoupitoulas do
I'd be down to wallow in New Orleans
See-through sunrise on the Waterloo
Slits are rather fancy when they're forming, I do

Better days
On the way
Flowing like a manta ray, the Dodgers made a double play
My dance moves are sub-subliminal

Let's make a wish as we enter the lift
'Cause the system's a relative bore
The drummer is leaning without any meaning
Outside of the Club Troubadour
I don't know you and I don't know what's true anymore, oh

Listen to my one request
I don't know you and I don't know what's true anymore"

She was barely seventeen
She was drinking whiskey sours in the bar
The way she tossed 'em back
I would've had a heart attack
But as it is, I let her drive my car

We galloped through the boroughs
Like a pair of horny thoroughbreds
Until I said, ""Stop the car, Doreen""
Now you can roll your eyes and nod
But I swear that I saw God
In the moonlight on a side street in the wreckage we call Queens

Doreen, Doreen
Last night I had an awful dream
You were laying in the arms of a man I'd never seen
Come clean, Doreen
Come clean, Doreen

Well, I'm pulling into Cleveland
In a seven-seater tour van
There's eight of us, so I'm sleeping on the floor
This guy that plays the banjo
Keeps on handing me the Old Crow
Which multiplies my sorrow, I can't take it anymore

Doreen, Doreen
Last night I had an awful dream
You were laying in the arms of a man I'd never seen
Come clean, Doreen
Come clean, Doreen

Now I'm begging and I'm pleading
""Well pull over guys, I'm bleeding
""There's a Fina off the highway with a phone""
I'm calling you, Doreen
But it rings and rings and rings
Where is it that you are, if you aren't in our bed at home?

En las nubes o en el suelo, donde quiera gritaré que te quiero

Prendida de mi cintura compartiendo el silencio
Igual quien quiera escucharme que vivo dentro del cielo

Que el corazón se me escapa del pecho

Que estás prendida cerquita de mi corazón

Agárrate que vengo con mucho swing

And trouble was never too hard to find

Bought a new enemy
She can smoke this doubt

Every disgrace already made
Every word tasting bitter and betrayed
Looking for lies, sympathy fuck
Useless heart didn't want to change my luck

What about today?

Sold you an alibi
Place me at the scene
I live a sorry lie
It burns like gasoline

That there's nothing left to be concealed
Moving on, a scene surreal
Know my heart will never, never be far from here

Sure as I'm breathing, sure as I'm sad
I'll keep this wisdom in my flesh
I leave here believing more than I had
And there's a reason I'll be, reason I'll be back

As I walk the hemisphere
I got my wish to up and disappear
I've been wounded, I've been healed
Now for landing I've been, landing I've been cleared

Sure as I'm breathing, sure as I'm sad
I'll keep this wisdom in my flesh

Looked out the shelter on the thunder and the rain
Storm passed over and the sun shown down
And the colors showed the way
Just chasin' a rainbow
Ain't no good reason why
Just chasin' a rainbow
Far across the sky
Well the track got muddy and the wheels bogged down
Lost a lot of good men, they wandered into town
Track got rocky on a hard luck mile
Lonely as the day is long
Just chasin' a rainbow
Far across the sky
Just chasin' a rainbow
Ain't no good reason why
Sometimes it seems like a lo-o-ong time ago
Like a long time ago
Sometimes it seems like a lo-o-ng time ago
Sometimes it feels like a li.i.ifetime
Well, there's a big rain comin', you can smell it in the air
Wind kickin' up, birds flying everywhere
Take to the meadow ‘til the air comes clear and the colors show the way
There's a new day comin' on down the line
A lost friend tryin' to set aside
Is it all just chance any way you go
Or a message in the mystery?
Just chasin' a rainbow

수십짜리 신발에 또 수백짜리 패딩
수십짜리 시계에 또 으스대지 괜히
교육은 산으로 가고 학생도 산으로 가
21세기 계급은 반으로 딱 나눠져
있는 자와 없는 자, 신은 자와 없는 자
입은 자와 벗는 자, 또 기를 써서 얻는 자
이게 뭔 일이니 유행에서 넌 밀리니?
떼를 쓰고 애를 써서 얻어냈지, 찔리지?
가득 찬 패딩 마냥 욕심이 계속 차
휘어지는 부모 등골을 봐도 넌 매몰차
친구는 다 있다고 졸라대니 안 사줄 수도 없다고
(Ayo baby) 철딱서니 없게 굴지 말어
그깟 패딩 안 입는다고 얼어 죽진 않어
패딩 안에 거위털을 채우기 전에
니 머릿속 개념을 채우길, 늦기 전에

내가 받은 돈 내가 쓰겠다는데
5천만의 취향을 다 니들처럼 맞춰야
만족할 사람들이지 제발 너나 잘 사셔
니 인생 말이여 니가 나면 말 안 하겠어
그래 내 패딩 더럽게 비싸고 더럽게 안 예뻐
(But I say) 너무 갖고 싶은데 어떡해
나보다 못 사는 친구들도 다 가졌는데
(And I say) 은따 되기 싫음 살 수밖에
이 나이 때쯤이면 원래 다들 좀 그러잖니

They met in high school in the '60s
Everyone knew it was love from the start
One July, in the midnight hour
He climbed up on the water tower
Stood on the rail and painted a ten-foot heart

In John Deere green, on a hot summer night
He wrote, ""Billy Bob loves Charlene,"" in letters three-foot-high
And the whole town said that he should've used red
But it looked good to Charlene in John Deere green

They settled down on eighty acres
Raisin' sweet corn, kids, and tomatoes
They went together like a hand in a glove
On a clear day, from their front yard
If you look and know what to look for
Off to the east, you can still read his words of love

In John Deere green, on a hot summer night
He wrote, ""Billy Bob loves Charlene,"" in letters three-foot-high
And the whole town said, ""The boy should've used red""
But it looked good to Charlene in John Deere green

Now more than once the town has discovered
Painting over it ain't no use
There ain't no paint in the world that'll cover it
The heart keeps showin' through

In John Deere green on a hot summer night
He wrote, ""Billy Bob loves Charlene,"" in letters three-foot-high
And the whole town said, ""The fool should've used red""
But it looked good to Charlene in John Deere green


Ah, paint it green, boy

Word up, hahahahaha (A sucker for love)

I should've seen you was trouble right from the start, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began, we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems, but we workin' at it, and now
The arguments are gettin' loud, I wanna stay
But I can't help from walkin' out, just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand if you could see
I never planned to be your man, it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin' for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin'
Soon as I opened up the door with your jealous questions
Like, where can I be? You're killin' me with your jealousy

Said you're pregnant and guess who the daddy? Don't wanna fall for it
But in this case what could I do? So now I'm back
To makin' promises to you, tryna keep it true
What if I'm wrong? A trick to keep me holdin' on
Tryna be strong and in the process, keep it goin'
I'm 'bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin' close
To packin' up and leavin' notes, and gettin' ghost
Tell me who knows a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head, I'm feelin' low, losin' control
My heart is sayin', ""Leave!"" Oh, what a tangled web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin' calls at the house, guess you cheatin'
That's all I need to hear, 'cause I'm leavin', I'm out the door
Never no more you will see me, this is the end

It used to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you, a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I should've seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin' tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry 'bout it, we can do it now, I'm under pressure
Make a decision 'cause I'm waitin', when I'm alone
I'm on the phone havin' secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery
Replace it with happiness but I need your faith in me, I'm a sucker for love

Where have all the good men gone and where are all the gods?
Where's the streetwise Hercules to fight the risin' odds?
Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?
Late at night, I toss and I turn and I dream of what I need

I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night
He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight

Somewhere just beyond my reach, there's someone reaching back for me
Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat
It's gonna take a Superman to sweep me off my feet, yeah

I need a hero

And he's gotta be larger than life
I need a hero

Up where the mountains meet the heavens above
Out where the lightning splits the sea
I could swear there is someone somewhere watching me
Through the wind and the chill and the rain
And the storm and the flood
I can feel his approach like a fire in my blood
(Like a fire in my blood, like a fire in my blood)
(Like a fire in my blood, like a fire in my blood, blood)

I need a hero (Hero)
I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night

Botei a mão no fogo por quem fez trairagem
Irradiei luz, nunca a escuridão me cegou
O céu é o limite e ao infinito eu vou
Sem desacreditar pra onda não me engolir
Quase perdi a fé, na demanda eu venci
Enfrentei o mar no que a embarcação naufragou
O céu é o limite e ao infinito eu vou
Se sentir livre é encontrar a paz
Se sentir livre é encontrar a paz
Nossa felicidade sempre incomodou
E hoje o mundo gira ao nosso favor
Os sonhos não morrem, enquanto houver a sede que me conduz
Os sonhos não morrem, que a fé renove como um raio de luz
Sei que não foi em vão, não temos tempo a perder
Os sonhos não morrem, venha ao meu lado e deixa estar, vamos viver
Da vida sempre espero o que é melhor pra mim
A história está aberta então vou construir o fim
Pra chegar até o amor que me disse quem eu sou
O céu é o limite e ao infinito eu vou

O meu medo levou (oh não)

A nova aurora chegou

Os sonhos não morrem, venha ao meu lado e deixa estar, vamos viver
Porque eu tô na área agora
Mulher é que adora o cara
Quando o cara vem embora que paga pau
A nova aurora comemora agora só loucura fora de memória ta fora fica na contramão
Here we go girl considera a nova área e pela bela libera acelera eu quero então
Here, I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go go
Se liga na volta dos que não foram
O indivíduo ta naquela batendo ou querendo não não bora tacar fogo então
Claro que no fim da mentira confira ta na mira ainda aquele que conspira demoro queimar no caldeirão
Quero ver quem decora meu flow tipo eram 3 mil ele se da bem
Rock'n'roll ninguém pega ela na pista atitude não se compra e respeito se conquista
Se eles promovem guerra e eu propago a paz
Eu só quero o que é meu e eles querem muito mais
Eu vivo pelo o que há de vir, eles pelo que passou
Só enxergam ódio onde eu vejo amor
Os sonhos não morrem, enquanto houver a sede que me conduz
Os sonhos não morrem, que a fé renove como um raio de luz
Sei que não foi em vão, não temos tempo a perder

See myself gaining the strength

Which replays in my head
I will pay my respects
I'm the angel of death
Now I aim for the space in the nape of thеir necks

When titans come in disturbing
Disarming them all like Erwin

Discover the secrets that my father left
That I'm learning
It's an act of god
Slice them down like Vagabond
Raising up the walls like Hammurabi did in Babylon
They babble on these bureaucrats did nothing for the poor
But nobody expected to be fighting in a hidden war

Make a team an anomaly
Follow me do it subtlety
Sick of all the dishonesty
Now go show your atrocity
As we slay these monstrosities
The founder is flowing all through my veins
Injected with the serum I'm about to go insane
Warriors from a different nation paved the way
For invasions that's all based on the men who dare betrayed
Every battle and all the life that we've lost
All the progress together came at a cost
Now we're banded as brothers and cannot stop
Freedom from the titans so we're rising to the top
I've inherited a legacy
And now I see the high degree of damage done
Lead a race of humans show
That this will be a fight that can be won
Giving all these people shoulders that they're standing on

I was born free within a prison of walls
(Feel the walls as their closing in)
Because I knew they'd never hold me so I let them fall
(Cus they all fall down)
Now I'm consumed with rage, blind to reason
Revenge I will take, nigh is freedom
I'm watchin' 'em tower but I'm standing tall
Cuz I want the power of 'em all

There's no running when you face death)
Even if this is suicide it'll be you and I
On the ride till the end

They say that money can't buy me love
But they don't know this Tenderoni
That I speaking of
She's so fly from her head to her toes
And I suppose
That's why I'm tricking off my dough
So if it's diamonds she wants, then I'll
I'll dig into a mine and search until I find
If it's a fur that she needs to keep warm
Then I'll wrestle a bear to keep her lovin' right here
Anything she wants, everything she gets
She wants it all the time
So I'll provide and buy
Anything she wants and everything she gets
Cuz all her love is mine
When she's satisfied
(Anything I want boy)
Ooh, that's what she said to me
She's a material girl
But that don't bother me
Check books, credit cards, American Express
Financially I'm twisted and addicted, I confess

Something like AK Nell
Better fuck me for free
Cuz when trickin'

Get her ass a goose

Dropped ""This is How We Do It""

You jump out of bed
Boggling, screaming timbo

Give her ass a ice pick
And then dismiss like Vibe did Chris

Looks like the weight of the world's
On your shoulders now

I know you think you're going crazy
Just when it seems everything's
Gonna work itself out
They drive you right back down

And you said it ain't fair
That a man walks
When a bird can fly
We have to kick the ground
The stars kiss the sky
They say that spirits live
A man has to die
They promised us truth
Now they're giving us lies

Gonna take a miracle to save us this time
And your savior has just left town
Gonna need a miracle
'Cause it's all on the line
And I won't let you down
(No I won't let you down)
The river of your hope is flooding
And I know the dam is busted
If you need me I'll come running
I won't let you down... no, no

You're looking for salvation
You thought that it'd be shining
Like an angel's light
Well, the angels left this nation
And salvation caught the last train
Out tonight
He lost one hell of a fight

He said
I'm just one man, that's all I'll ever be
I never can be everything you wanted from me
I've got plans so big
That any blind man could see
I'm standing in the river
Now I'm drowning in the sea

Gonna take a miracle to save us this time
And your savior has just left town
Gonna need a miracle
'Cause your heart's on the line
And your heartbeat is slowing down
Your feet are grounded still
You're reaching for the sky
You can let 'em clip your wings
'Cause I believe that you can fly


Well my eyes have seen the horror
Of the coming of the flood
I've driven deep the thorny crown
Into the soul of someone's son
Still I'll look you in the eye
'Cause I've believed in things I've thought
And I'll die without regret
For the wars I have fought

Gonna take a miracle to save you this time
And your savior has just left town
Gonna need a miracle
'Cause your heart's doing time
And your conscience is calling you out
It ain't all for nothing
Life ain't written in the sand
I know the tide is coming
But it's time we made a stand
With a miracle

Bramwell, West Virginia is my home
A little mining town in Mercer County
But as a boy I swore I'd never dig that coal
As a boy I swore I'd never dig that coal

At sixteen years, I hopped a freight train
Set out to seek my fortune with a song
This old guitar, my one companion
Lord, I was born to be a rollin' stone

And I roam this world around from Maine to California
But I'm missin' where the treetops drape the sky
This old troubadour is longing for the hills of West Virginia
And I'll return to Windy Mountain before I die
I'll return to Windy Mountain before I die

I had a girl on Windy Mountain
With hair of gold and eyes of crystal blue
A home and family she was countin'
Whеn I hopped that train, it broke her hеart in two

And I roam this world around from Maine to California
Left some pretty girls with teardrops in their eyes
But the one I truly love is back in West Virginia
So I'll return to Windy Mountain before I die
I'll return to Windy Mountain before I die

When I return to Windy Mountain
And the good Lord takes me to my final home
Bury me where the howlin' winds blow
And place these lonesome words upon my stone:

""He roamed this world around from Maine to California
Now he's resting where the treetops drape the sky
An old troubadour at peace in the hills of West Virginia
He returned to Windy Mountain before he died
Now he lives on Windy Mountain up on high."""

Ayo, Black—it's time, word (Word, it's time, man)
Yeah, it's time, man (Aight, man, begin)
Yeah—straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yo—now;

Rappers: I monkey-flip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin'
Musician, inflictin' composition of pain
I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holdin' an M16, see, with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up with street clothes
Hand me a .9 and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughin' at baseheads, tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers, ""Back up!""—the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him backflip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, ""Yo, my shit is stuck!""
Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So, now I'm jettin' to the buildin' lobby
And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be
(So, what you sayin'?) It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us
.45’s and gauges, MAC's in fact
Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks
In black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, huh, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in a New York State of Mind

New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TECs
Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stock, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops
But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin'
Thinkin' of cash flow, Buddha, and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta
In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back, black
I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
I'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind

New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

I know that you get jealous, so I'll play the fantasy
I know it gives you hell when everyone looks at me
Some of my favorite moments usually start with tears
Swear that you'll pull me closer whenever we flirt with fear

I'll be the villain tonight
I kinda like when you despise me after we fight
(Feels so much better when I'm)
Pushin' all your buttons 'til you're crawlin' on the floor
You say you hate my guts, but you're still comin' back for more

I'll be
The villain, uh, uh, the villain, I'll be
The villain, uh, uh, the villain, I'll be
The villain, uh, uh, the villain, I'll be
The villain, uh, uh, the villain, I'll be

What's you and I without a little pain?
Tastes bittersweet each time you say my name
If love was poison, we would drink it anyways
Feels so good playing these wicked little games

I'll be the villain tonight
I kinda like when you despise me after we fight

Heard the thunder down below
When I heard that, wind on the mountain, and my blood ran cold
An' it was singin' awoooooooo-oooooooo-oooo-ooo 
So we went climbin' higher and higher, on up into the clouds
An' it was snowing up on Georgia Pass, and we could not find our way down
Will I lay my bones to rest, shiver out in the pines

I gotta make some money to buy some brand new shoes
Tryin' to find somebody to take away these blues
""She don't love me"", hear them singing in the sun
Payday's coming when my work is all done

Later in the evening when the sun is sinking low
All day I been waiting for the whistle to blow
Sitting in a teepee built right on the tracks
Rolling them bones until the foreman comes back
Pick up your belongings boys and scatter about
We've got an off-schedule train comin' two miles out

Everybody's scrambling n' 'jumping around
Picking up their money, tearing the teepee down
Foreman wants to panic 'bout to go insane
Trying to get the workers out the way of the train
Engineer blows the whistle long and long
Can't stop the train, you have to let it roll on"

Spend a little too much time together
Forgotten how to be all by ourselves
Could be worse, yeah it could be better
Stay inside beyond all others
Help won’t get me out of bed
Stop the voices in my head
Waste away with you instead alone, alone
The great inside and fortitude
Safely home alone with you
Wasting time but what a view you are
{Pre-Chorus}
Nobody told me when you love someone for real
That your mind’s on hold and your heart’s behind the wheel
{Chorus}
I'm so caught up with you
Slow love in solitude
Don't eat and we drink too much
Four walls and that one room love
We’ll drift away again
You give me something to numb the pain
We don't talk and we keep the door shut
We’re together just a little too much
{Bridge}
I'll lay awake in the middle of the night thinking about home
Feel so alone though I'm with you
Not the same as I used to be
My friends all lost touch with me
And there's nobody to blame but myself

Nobody told me when you love someone for real
That your mind’s on hold and your heart’s behind the wheel

I'm so caught up with you
Slow love in solitude
Don't eat and we drink too much
Four walls and that one room love
We’ll drift away again

And the party wasn't here and there's bills to pay
But she hasn't seen her lawyer since Saint Agnes Day
The brothers Finn begin with a scotch on rocks
Good thing that the dolly never learned to talk
And they took down forty chapels just to fill them in
And this is where the party will begin

Welcome, my friends, to the Midnight Caberet
Where the drinks are free but you really must stay
We'll dance all night till the house falls down
But we'll never pull your body from the bleeding ground
We'll never pull your body from the ground

Little Bradley's ruined and he's only seventeen
Head shaped like a pool cue and a thing for gasoline
Set his house aflame and he didn't get a cent
'Cause he's four months late upon his first month's rent
House reinvented for the newlywed
Good thing that their contract surely went unread
And he put his wife to bed and the bed fell through the floor
And he jumped out of the window, couldn't take it anymore

Welcome, my friends, to the Midnight Caberet
Where the drinks are free but you really must stay
We'll dance all night till the house falls down
But we'll never pull your body from the bleeding ground
We'll never pull your body from the ground

Losin' my religion
Tryin' to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper
Of every waking hour
I'm choosin' my confessions
Tryin' to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost, and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

Consider this
Consider this, the hint of the century
Consider this, the slip
That brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies come
Flailing around?
Now, I've said too much

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

That's me in the corner

Oh no, I've said too much

Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empezamos lento, después salvaje

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamo' pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza

If I feel dirty at all
Cause it gets hard to tell
It's never just black and white
She's got a mind of her own and she uses it well
So she invites me over outside Villanova
She's got some pull-out sofa that we won't hardly need
She is only drinking soda, revving up that motor
Got places we could go to, but I still won't believe
That she's only gifted
When I'm standing by her side
She goes unassisted
And I start to relax as I cut her some slack
CHORUS
So get up, I gotta go to work
Facing all these people who now know I'm a jerk
And it's a set-up, I gotta change my clothes
Concealing all this evidence before everybody knows
What I've done and what I'm gonna do again
And in the middle of the night
I have a breakdown of sorts with regret creeping in
She's gonna put up a fight
And she will get her way, cause she loves sleeping in
So I need someone to side with when she begins confiding
And I cannot provide it cause I'm endlessly cold
She says she's so excited to play some groom and bride
With me but I'm undecided so I need to be told
That she's only sinking
When I'm sleeping by her side
With a change of thinking
I could pull us away even just for a day
CHORUS
So get up, I gotta go to work
Facing all these people who now know I'm a jerk
And it's a set-up, I gotta change my clothes
Concealing all this evidence before everybody knows
What I've done and what I'm gonna do again
She grows impatient to change my tune
She's getting older and legal soon
And I wasn't ready to start out and go upsetting
Some girl that I'd be forgetting
By the time the cops came by that afternoon
And I try to decide as she pulls me aside
CHORUS
So get up, I gotta go to work
Facing all these people who now know I'm a jerk
And it's a set-up, I gotta change my clothes
Concealing all this evidence before everybody knows

Let's get ready to rumble
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah (Now, you know how we do it, like a G)
You don't wanna fuck with me (What really go on in the mind of a nigga)
Got the police bustin' at me (That get down for theirs)
But they can't do nothin' to a G (Constantly, let 'em screaming that, money over bitches)

Police bustin' at me (My ambitions as a ridah)
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
Got the police bustin' at me (I'm a straight ridah)

So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars (Skrrt)
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public (Hahaha)
My attitude was ""fuck it,"" 'cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease (Sir, sir, sir, sir)
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
(And, uh) And my ambitions as a ridah
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her (Uh, got ya)
Then I spit some game in her ear, ""Go to the telly, ho""
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke (Hahaha)
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay us
I got no time for these bitches (Hell no), 'cause these hoes tried to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin'
Competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin' (Booyah)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so (Haha)
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on a scheme to come and trick us (Haha)
But thug niggas be on point and game tight (Yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart are strapped up the same night (Wassup, nigga?)
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous, 'cause deep in they hearts they wanna be me

Coward motherfuckers I despise, when it's time to ride
I was the first to hop inside (Let's go, nigga, let's go), give me the .9 (Haha, yeah)
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life (Yeah, nigga)
That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So I open fire until you kill me, witness my steel (That's all you niggas got? Hahahahahahahaha)
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama (Dear Mama), come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught (Fuck, shoot)
Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice (Fuck this shit)
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson (Fuck that)
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then, nigga, die for it

Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G

My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Stay off the block, evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years (I'm back, baby)
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
(Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck) Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish
My powers, so now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace (Them niggas cowards)
They cowards, that's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas (Bitch-ass niggas) on my team so indeed they wet me up (Punk niggas)
But I'm back reincarnated ('Carnated), incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money, I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it (Hahaha)
Knowin', when I get out, they gon' feel it (Yeah, right)
Witness the realest, a who-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cries from all your people when they find her, must remind ya
(Thug life) My history'll prove I been it
Revenge on them niggas that played me and all the cowards that was down with it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya
Hopin' you listen, got you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah

It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you"" — ""No, you ain't
Come back"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that’s the culprit, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"

And it's waiting for the dark so it can eat me up alive

I end up sleeping in the hall
'Cause you're too busy with important things
And you smile and say that you believe
But you're not listening to me
They're coming out to get me

Why don't you believe me? It's not all inside my head
Something wants to eat me, it lives underneath my bed
Well, I gotta keep these lights on or I'll never get to sleep
'Cause there's something in this bedroom and it's giving me the creeps

I try to tell you that I'm scared
You act like you don't even care
You just pat me on the head and walk away
You're gabbing downstairs on the phone
You leave me in the dark alone

So the world's unfair, keep it locked out there

That works for me, whoop—


Yeah
Full steam ahead, take this dead girl walkin'
How'd you find my address?
Let's break the bed, rock this dead girl walkin'
I think you tore my mattress

No sleep tonight for you
Better chug that Mountain Dew (Okay, okay)
Get your ass in gear
Make this whole town disappear (Okay, okay)
Slap me, pull my hair
Touch me 
there and there and there
And no more talkin' (No-oh-oh-oh)

Done blown my mind and set me free

How I wound up down here in Monroe
Somethin' I'm never gonna figure out it's true
But your sweet love settled me down
Made me quit all my ramblin' around
Now all I wanna do is sit home and go with you
And last night I heard a freight train through my window
And I couldn't help thinkin' as I heard that whistle scream
How that ol' lonesome sound
Don't make me itch and wanna move around

On another day
I'll get carried away
And let go of all madness that I'm faced with today
All the time
Spent feeling blind
Trapped without an escape
Time to turn over the pages to discover my way
There's a place in another land where our troubles should go
Planting peace just to understand all the ways it can grow
All the good times and the bad ones
All the beautiful mistakes
All together tell the story of how strong we're made to be
Yea made to be
Tired eyes
And a cluttered mind
So much life in the way
A reflection of the choices that I'm faced with today
Pause the rewind
Get stuck in play
Break the cycle of strain
'Cause tomorrow's always coming to deliver today
There's a place in another land where our troubles should go
Planting peace just to understand all the ways it can grow
All the good times and the bad ones
All the beautiful mistakes
All together tell the story
Of how strong we're made to be
So move me quickly yea here we go
When the rain comes down tell my story
A calm relaxing from head to toe
When the breeze returns my former glory
'Cause life is taxing on the heart and soul
As the trees, they ease my ever worry
A delayed reaction to us growing old
We were made to be together for it
There's a place in another land where our troubles should go
Planting peace just to understand all the ways it can grow
All the good times and the bad ones
All the beautiful mistakes
All together tell the story
Of how strong we're meant to be
We are miracles in action
Built to handle all the weight
Don't get caught up in distraction

4QPyH4yu9SxdFU17ucbIWE,Yonder Mountain String Band,On the Run,0.961,0.671,Q1_Happy,"A man stood in the shadows, his face was drippin' sweat
He took a break from runnin' but he wasn't done yet
Looked over his shoulder when he heard the barkin' hounds
Dug his feet into the earth and headed out of town

Town line's far away, and
He won't sleep for days
Because he just slept with Annie and she's the sheriff's wife
Now the sheriff's men have got him runnin' for his life

He knew the girl was trouble but he wasn't thinkin' clear
When she put her hand onto his leg and filled his glass with beer
A deputy could see them and tracked the sheriff down
Just had time to grab his clothes and highball out of town

Town line's far away, and
He won't sleep for days
And even if he makes it, there's nothin' he can do
But hope and pray the sheriff there hasn't heard the news

A man stood in the shadows thinkin' about the past
'Bout all the women he had known and livin' life too fast
He heard a noise behind him, felt a gun against his head
Should've known the sheriff wouldn't rest 'til he was dead

Town line's far away, and
He's six feet in the grave
He's lyin' there with Annie, who was the sheriff's wife
'Til the sheriff and his men robbed them of their lives"

7zumacGldlmxpoP8bpaeLe,Squeeze,Slap & Tickle,0.919,0.805,Q1_Happy,"She was frigid like a bible
When she met her boyfriend Michael
He took her in his Zephyr
They sat like salt and pepper
Looking out across the city
From Lover's Leap is pretty
The lights they flick and flutter
He told her how he loved her
Next night he called for her
But dad protected daughter
And told him she was poorly
A lie was told there surely
So Michael felt rejected
This wasn't quite expected
He drove off to his local
Where he felt anti-social

She cried all night at missing
The boy she could be kissing
While he was falling over
He drunk himself back sober
And went home in a taxi
And crashed out in the back seat
He slept just like a baby
Which he hadn't done just lately
He saw her in the morning
Out with his sister Pauline
She felt all shy and soppy
He acted cool and cocky
He said tonight at Charlie's
There's going to be a party
I'll meet you at half seven
She visualized the heaven

If you ever change your mind
Which you do from time to time
Never chew a pickle
With a little slap and tickle
You have to throw the stone
To get the pool to ripple

That night they danced together
It looked like love forever
He put his hand on her leg
You should have heard what she said
He tried again much later
It seemed to aggravate her
He drove home in silence
Avoiding all violence
She said let's watch the city
From Lover's Leap is pretty
I think I need the fresh air
She put a comb through her hair
Then while she turned to kiss him
And very nearly missed him
She put her hand on his leg
He felt her tongue in his head"

Todo lo que perciban
Solo es producto de su imaginación
Nada es real

Aquí no hay truco
Te escupo, te voy a dejar de luto
Te ejecuto con mi rap executor
No existe un puto tutorial, la diferencia es abismal, muy basta
Muy bestia, hasta la fecha no hay truco, es mi ciencia exacta
En el acta va con el acto, parto tú factor, tú hardcore
Por morbo domino el rap como Yamakasi el parkour
Rap tocho, no es magia, no escondo nada en las mangas
Puedo hacer que groupies me enseñen bastante más que el tanga
Respiro... porque este rap es a saco
No hay truco, aunque puedo ver a través de cristales opacos
No soy mago y te saco metáforas de la chistera
Que puedo manipularte e hipnotizarte a la primera
Yo te meto en una caja y te corto por la mitad
¿Cuestión de magia?, ¡qué va! Cuestión de saber hacer rap
La edad no importa, soy Porta y no poseo una varita
Pero poseo tu cuerpo, niña, sé que mi rap te excita
Muchos me envidian, bueno, mejor dicho, me odian
Y es por que mi rap es mucho mejor que todas sus parodias
Todos los días tan solo me dedico a esto
Que soy para el rap lo que fue Jordan para el baloncesto
No hay truco ni abradacadabra que valga
Aunque algunos digan que soy el mago de la palabra
Es underground recién salido del horno
Soy para el rap lo que ya fue Nacho Vidal pa'l cine porno
Aquí no hay comentarios tontos, sino tontos que comentan
Escuchan, buscan un fallo mío y si no hay se lo inventan
Me revienta el que no sabe, a el que le da por opinar
Juzgar algo que ni siquiera se molestó en escuchar
Soy el nuevo David Copperfield, valgo más que el marfil
El nuevo sex symbol, cojí un boli Bic, te rompí
No hay truco, no busques la receta
Tendrás que aceptar que simplemente yo lo parto en la maqueta

No todo tiene truco, aunque esto sea sorprendente
No es cuestión de edades, ya penetro en vuestras mentes
Dispuesto a dar el golpe, buscar el significado
Sin prisa, pero sin pausa, con trampas nunca he jugado
No todo tiene truco, aunque esto sea sorprendente

Soy buen MC, un crack como Messi, podéis llamarme mesías
Yo las clavo por la escuadra y no las huele ni Casillas
Esto es rap, soy un crack aunque te joda
Toma comas, Soma en el beat, en el rebeat, this is my shit, no es broma
Tu mierda de LP yo lo compro en el top manta
Lo guardo en la papelera de reciclaje, no se salva
No es cuestión de edades, se folló a todos los ...ejem
Ni te imaginas las descargas que conseguí en solo un mes
Topo de anónimo, sinónimo de cobarde
Fardas mucho delante de tus colegas, vas de
Lo que no eres, quieres ser lo que quieren que seas
Eres un chupa-culos, si quieres te pongo la correa
Aquí no hay truco, es brusco, rap bruto, no es magia negra
El rap que viene directamente de una mente enferma
No todo tiene explicación, no le busques el truco
A ver si aceptas de una vez por todas que soy bueno y punto
Os cierro la boca y a la vez babeáis
Antes mucho ""bla, bla, bla"" y ahora tartatamudeáis
Soy Neruda en la escritura y en mente Anthony Blake
Está de moda eso de hacer amigos en el MySpace
En el palco de honor estoy, b-boy, no quieres darte cuenta
Que no soy yo, sino tu música la que está en venta
Vente, que el segundo sigue siendo el primero que pierde
Hay muchos perros que ladran, pero muy pocos muerden
Primer round, esto es flow, no down, soy promesa underground
Te manipulo y juego con mentes como en Saw
Como Tyson hacer caos, acercaós, veréis que lo parto
De un high kick vocal-verbal tu rap morderá el asfalto
¿Queréis jugar? Y el jugador tambien forma parte del juego
Tú le echas cojones, pero yo le pongo un par de huevos
Le echas leña al fuego y yo le echo fuego a la leña
No soy maño y te lo hago con maña, aquí no hay truco, peña

Son dejavu, son te follas a tu exnovia
Me tienen rabia, fobia, me aman y a la vez me odian
Tengo voz de niñato, tal vez, aunque se que te pone
Fardo de rap, quizá, y no de tener un cuerpo Danone
Me salgo, valgo como un mago, te hago juegos palabrares
El rap sin censura, pero para todas las edades
Los que critiquen en foros que os den por el culo a todos
Tu eres gordo, lo bordo, pero a qué coño lo rompo
Muy pronto de vuelta, solo en las mejores salas
Me cansé de cortar alas, como Neo esquivo balas
No hay truco, es como un puzzle que monto pieza a pieza
Soma, después de este rap tendrás que dejar tus quejas (Puto Porta)
No hay truco, ¿no te lo crees? Coje la puerta y vete
Siempre te veo por el suelo como Sete
Gibernau; te machaco como Pau
Gasol; soy el MVP del año, so flipao
Cuánta gente me envidia y me la suda el qué dirán
Yo un vacilón más y también mi propio fan
El dos va después del uno, ¿demasiada información de golpe?
Que soy para el rap lo que para playa una tía en topless
Tonto, soy de oro, soy el que lo rompe y suena guapo
Puedo hacerlo fluido, si prefieres te la encajo
Respiro y dejo un hueco para que encaje en la caja
Lógico que al escucharme te mates a pajas
Cuántas bocas habré cerra'o ya, ¡dime cuántas!
Os la pongo tiesa, sabéis que mi rap os la levanta
De la nada se hace todo y del todo se hace nada
Os llevo años de luz ventaja, este rap suena a sobrada
Y es que las grupies por Messenger agotan mi paciencia
Soy lo máximo, elevado hasta su máxima potencia
Harto de la competencia poco competente
Tengo pelo L'Oréal, Pantene, no hay adversarios decentes
Ole, cojo un boli y un folio, siempre he odia'o que me controlen
A todos los que inventan falsos rumores: ¡Que les follen!
Soy el nuevo rookie, esto no se aprende en el instituto
Vuelvo para demostrar que detrás de mi rap no hay truco

No todo tiene truco, aunque esto sea sorprendente

My only talent is making you stressed
I know that I'm not at my best
Lately I'm feeling like less
I hope that I see you again
If I don't then I'll lay it to rest

It's crazy how it goes
Left me all alone
I've been tryna move on
All I find are hoes
Searching for a pot of gold
Don't know if I'll ever know
How she left me with no damn place to go

I'm okay, I'll be fine
I'm just out of my mind
Long nights, with no sleep
Thinking about you and me
I'm okay, I'll be fine
I'm just out of my mind
Long nights, with no sleep
Thinking about you and me

Spеnt 5 months at your crib
And I ain't pay no rent
We should of just been friends
Causе I know that you never meant
All the things that you said to me
Froze my heart in uncertainty
Go ahead hit the club or some
Make sure that you drunk as fuck
Find you another man to love
Ima show you what you lost
Ima show you how it feels to realize
Everything you ever knew
And everything you ever had in love is gone

I'm okay, I'll be fine
I'm just out of my mind
Long nights, with no sleep
Thinking about you and me
I'm okay, I'll be fine
I'm just out of my mind
Long nights, with no sleep
Thinking about you and me

I guess this shit for real
And if I had another chance
I don't know if I'd take that bet against you with another man
And if I ever saw your face
Then I would probably take a glance
But I would never bat an eye
Because you hate me that's a fact
I think this is an epiphany
I don't think you really listening
One day you're gonna be missing me
I swear to god we'll never be frienemies
Bitches trying to be friends with me
I think they stealing my energy
In my DM's and they tempting me
I know that you really resenting me now

I'm okay, I'll be fine
I'm just out of my mind
Long nights, with no sleep
Thinking about you and me
I'm okay, I'll be fine
I'm just out of my mind
Long nights, with no sleep
Thinking about you and me"

I have done my best
Against the odds and then
From time to time you're gone

Time and space won't keep us down
I see your face and my feet don't touch the ground

We could see each other floating through the girl
And every move I make takes me back to you
And when we're sure it's over
The light comes shining through
In the time it takes to love me - I love you
Time and space won't keep us down
I see your face and my feet don't touch the ground
Listen to me now, the stars are all asleep
Shoot me through the clouds, 'cause you still hold the key
To open up my heart
That's when the screaming starts
I heard she's leaving town, so I won't stick around
In the time it takes to love me - I love you

É que o meu peito tem espaço só pros 'croco' da Lalá
Eu cansei desses 'perreco', maluca
Vou passar com a loirona empinada na garupa
Vou passar chaveando, fumando só das pura'
Vou deixar suas amiga' querendo aventura, loucura
(MC Rick)
Chute no balde, calçando Nike
Não sou mais feliz contigo, ainda 'to indo tarde, na real nunca é tarde
Porque essa mina é fraude, pensa que é parque de diversão o coração do drake
Pegue sua vida e vê se some do meu campo de visão
Me deu presente, deu buceta, mas não me deu coração
E agora ela me liga, voucher subiu, evoluiu, não te quero, sai, filha
Trampo fluiu, cash caiu, agora é só alegria
Vai, bebê, boa sorte. Quer saber de como eu 'to, só acompanhar no stories
Chutei o balde, dessa vez nóis foi de Nike Shox

Ah, mas é que ainda é segunda-feira, eu acordando tarde tipo lá pras 4
Várias 'responsa' pra eu desenrolar, ela pede no peito, ela fica de quatro
Como que eu saio do quarto? Um brinde à vida, deixa ela se acabar
Tem mais seis dia na semana, então vamo' bora
Eu não sei quanto tempo ainda tenho aqui, não sei quantos conto' que eu tenho na conta
Coloca a boca pa' me ver sorrir, não liga pro flash, quem filma não conta
Cara de mal, posturado e tal
Magnífico de luva não, só que de caneta
Obrigado, meu Deus, bota ela na cara do gol
Toma que é de graça, então receba
Eu sou aquele que você odeia amar
Eu sou o 'trem' que 'cê quer doutrinar
A vida é breve, eu não posso parar
Então não chora não
Oh, sei que 'tá foda de encontrar o amor
Mas se quer pau, nóis te dá toda hora
Vou te falar que o meu relógio quebrou, então 'cê já sabe, né
(MC Ryan SP)
Me acostumando com a dor da solidão
É que 'cê não entende que eu vivi uma ilusão
A vida vai trazer o sofrimento
E a dor que 'tá aqui dentro vai passar, as ferida do coração
Eu tenho uma Porsche que me leva aonde eu quero
Eu tenho algumas brisa que me deixa' bipolar
O ego deixa bem alguns momento' da minha vida
Mas sempre me deixa mal que vi que perdi quem amar
Os falsos me odeiam e dão risada do meu lado
As puta jura' amar na medida que eu mando pix
Eu vejo tudo isso e sei que não 'to enganado
Mas sempre me distraio com uma dose de whisky
Vai colocar na mesa o valor do combo comprado
Aproveita e coloca o preço da sua solidão
Quando 'tá você e seu travesseiro no teu quarto
Tentando se iludir na noite de uma depressão
Enquanto isso nóis dá close, as paty faz a pose
Com quinze puta cara na lancha lá da P12
Menor faz 'hang loose', os drake joga doce
Na mente das cavala que senta e ama o 12
Fogo no zé povinho, que eu 'to com o Joãozinho
No rebanho de quenga, na rave do Ronaldinho
Fogo no zé povinho, que eu 'to com o Joãozinho
No rebanho de quenga, na rave do Ronaldinho
(MC Tuto)
Ontem mesmo eu 'tava 'crazy', me senti na Riviera
Com duas lá do cone que gosta da bagaceira
Só royal vinte um anos no suporte da BM
O que o pix não faz, na transferência ela se rende
Bota fogo na 'party', liga pro Joãozinho
Na pegada de artista, só tchau pro zé povinho
Vivendo e sabendo que no fundo sou mais eu
E elas fala bem, se falar mal, não conheceu
Se hoje tem bagunça, vou nos traje de Lalá
R4 é o que pisa, e invejoso sai pra lá
Em paz eu 'to vivendo, então deixa nóis 'marolar'
Ditado do momento, se não ouviu tu vai escutar
Vamo' buscar o hexa, seis linda morena' lota o banco da Meca
Que o chute é certeiro, engavetei e trouxe ela
Tchau pro sofrimento, pro 'zé bica na canela'

Dogs in the dust
She's not gone yet but she's leaving
And she'll take what she needs and she'll do what she must

When she knew just what she'd become
Oh let me tell ya that...

She's one part evil, three-fifths blind

I wish you loved you and gave yourself loving
'Cause loving yourself is true wealth, honey
I wish you loved you as much as you love him

You say it ain't a big deal 'cause he's gonna change

Somewhere I'd be free to roam

Up where the old man bends

And the sweet Borealis play
It occurred to me:
Am I alone or free
Or maybe they're just the same?

Oh
Ah, yeah

An manchen Tagen hasse ich es, dein'n Duft zu riechen
Hasse diese Sonntage, wenn wir uns bei dir verkriechen
Weißt du noch, wie wir immer in dei'm Bett lagen?
Nur wir beide eingerollt in ei'm Bettlaken
Manchma' hass' ich es, hasse deine süße Stimme
Ich hasse es, diese Schmetterlinge in mir drinne
Ich hasse es, wenn wir streiten übers Telefon
Frag' mich, ob sich die Geschichte mit uns beiden wirklich lohnt
Ich fass' es nicht, aber ehrlich, manchma' hass' ich dich
Könnte alles an dir verfluchen und verachte dich
Verachte dich und frag' mich, warum du so bist
Ich sprech' es nicht laut aus, doch manchmal wünscht ich, dass du—
Ich weiß, dass du alles gibst und mir den Rücken stärkst
Manchma' wär es besser, wenn du mir einfach den Rücken kehrst
Manchma' hass' ich dich, denn du bist so eifersüchtig
Wenn du ehrlich bist, denkst du, wir sind beide glücklich?

Hass und Liebe liegen so nah beieinander, Schatz
Und deswegen liegen wir auch beieinander, Schatz
Ich glaube, es ist besser, ich lasse dich in Frieden

Wie du gehst, wie du schläfst, den Geschmack, wenn du mich küsst
Ich liebe dich, du bist zärtlich zu dei'm Mann
Immer ehrlich zu dei'm Mann, ich halte an um deine Hand, Engel
Doch hasse es, wenn du mich wieder mal abfuckst
Kein'n Grund hast, doch mich nur mit Vorwürfen wach machst
Lass das, ich hass' es so krass, tagein, tagaus
Deine Unterstellungen geh'n da rein, da raus
Ich liebe es, wenn du mich sanft mit dei'm Lächeln weckst
Liebe es, dass du dich nicht intressierst fürs Rapgeschäft
Ich liebe es, du bist da und gibst mir Zuversicht
Doch an manchen Tagen will ich einfach, dass du mich vergisst
Ich hasse es, dass du immer an meiner Seite bist
Ich kann nicht mehr, manchmal bräucht ich auch ma' bisschen Zeit für mich
Eigentlich müsst ich dich verfluchen, doch ich kann es nicht
Weil du, egal, was noch kommt, mein Ein und Alles bist

Every woman and man
Trying to find some purpose in their lives
Some way to survive

Riddle's my middle name
I'm not a saint
I've got no complaints:
There's a lot of worse things I ain't
I'm crackin' up
I'm crackin' up
People wanna put their tag on you
Define what you do
And you might enjoy some small renown
But it's hard to live down
Stuck in a mould
Do what you're told
A product that's bought and sold
Made out of straw
Sentenced before
The Court Of Unwritten Law
I'm crackin' up
I'm crackin' up
I won't stand for it so I am
Crackin' up
I've got no time for it so I am
Crackin' up
Though I hide behind a cool facade
I can't drop my guard
Almost made myself a nervous wreck
Keeping feelings in check
You've gotta perform
Stick to the norm
Wishing you were never born
You've gotta behave
Facing looking brave
And you'll dig yourself an early grave"

While niggas bite immediately, if not soon
Set the lynchin', inform the execution date

Hand on my nut sack and spittin' lunghies

Bathroom passes, cutting classes, squeezing asses
Smoking blunts was a daily routine, since 13

Now I got the MAC in my knapsack (That's right... that's right...)
Lounging, black – smoking sacks up in Ac's and Sidekicks
With my sidekicks (A-heh), rocking fly kicks
Honeys want to chat –
But all we wanna know is ""Where the party at?! And can I bring my gat?""
If not, I hope I don't get shot
Better throw my vest on my chest, 'cause niggas is a mess
It don't take nothin' but frontin' for me to start something

Dumbing out, just me and my crew

""If money smell bad, then this nigga Biggie stinkin'!"" (Pshh...)

Rolled up another blunt, bought a Heineken (Yes, please...)
Niggas start to loc out, a kid got choked out
Blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out

[Indecipherable sounds of people yelling and arguing
Biggie breaks it up yelling ""Yo, chill, man, chill!""]

Get her pissy drunk off of Dom Pérignon

But it's alright, we can still go on
But it's alright, we can still go on
But it's alright, we can still go on
Time has been lost in trying
We have been left outside
Looking at passions dying
Emotions grow stronger all the time
But it's alright, we can still go on
But it's alright, we can still go on
But it's alright, we can still go on
But it's alright, we can still go on
Alright still go on
Alright still go on
Alright still go on"

Lo nuestro e' algo aparte y la cama fue testigo
De to'a esa' noche', de to' eso' gemido'
Todavía escucho tu vo' cerquita de mi oído
Má' alante vive gente, pero no me he movido
Sigo estanca'o, en tus recuerdo' perdío'
El DM explota'o, pero la' dejo en leído
Mi' letra' siempre tienen tu nombrе y apellido
Viviendo con mil pregunta', еl lápi' sin punta
De todo lo que escribo, ma', tú tiene' la culpa
Llevo año' pagando la misma multa
Tú ere' ese mal que no sé por qué me gusta
El no poder olvidarte me frustra
Te lo juro que me frustra

Pero si me llama' le llego volando
En la Mercede' voy capsuleando
Y cuando no está', te sigo imaginando
Sin ropa en mi cama, mi nombre gritando
Y si me llama' le llego volando
En la Mercede' voy capsuleando
Y cuando no está', te sigo imaginando
Sin ropa en mi cama, mi nombre gritando, oh

Y si me llama' yo le caigo en el AMG
Baby, pa' terminar lo que a mitad dejé
En la cama hicimo' una serie, pero no PG
Y aunque me alejé
Sigo viendo tu cara cuando a otra se lo pongo
Si todavía tengo tu wallpaper de fondo
Ando sin salvavida' nadando en lo hondo
Yo siento tus látido' aunque me quede sordo

Y dime tú cómo e' que se sana este dolor
Si ya lavé la' sábana', pero siguen con tu olor
Y yo solo pido sentir de nuevo tu calor
Ya probé una' cuanta', pero extraño tu sabor

Así que si me llama le llego volando
Todo e' mejor si ignora' lo que andan comentando
Y cuando no está' te sigo imaginando
Sin ropa en mi cama, mi nombre gritando, oh-oh"

Slip it underneath her door

Buried and burdened, my patience was gone
Blinded, my vision was wrong
Head underwater in waves I could see
I found the strength in me, the strength in me
Get up, get up

I can finally breathe again
Standing on my own two feet again
Learning that my scars won't bleed again
Mistakes I couldn't undo, try to destroy you
I can finally breathe again
I can finally breathe again

It's getting darker, numbing the pain inside
Feels like forever, all the times I've tried
To be mysеlf, break the chains, no one еver sees
I found the strength in me

I can finally breathe again
Standing on my own two feet again
Learning that my scars won't bleed again
Mistakes I couldn't undo, try to destroy you
I can finally breathe again
Breathe again

Letting go of the weight inside
Can we give this another try?
Letting go, I feel alive

Standing on my own two feet again
Learning that my scars won't bleed again
Mistakes I couldn't undo, try to destroy you
I can finally breathe again

My eyes have been vacuum-sealed

We should be more adventurous with our meals

They annoy me, those who employ me
They could destroy me
They should enjoy me

I drag myself into the town

Like a rash on the back of a manky cat
Now in I go like a fool
I can't resist dipping in the pool
I watch them, watch me, watching too
Across the street across the room
I dress myself like a charcoal sketch
My eyes are brown and my hair's a mess

You put in so much effort to just make a dollar

Suddenly these feelings mean nothing to me
She said i’ll call you right back when i’m back in a week
Why you ask me if i’m busy i got no place to be
Lately i’ve just been so bored there is just nothing to see
And i’m sick of wasting time
It’s just to precious to me
And she’s jealous i can see it when she’s talking to me
Anxious i’ve just been stressing out
Over things that don’t matter i’ll just work it out

The way you talked to me like i knew something

There you were saying you don’t care where we are
Taking all the time just to decide
If you don’t wanna talk then it’s all right

You can put your money where your mouth is, but you're so unsure
I could be a miser or a big spender
But you might get much more than you bargained for
Check in on a checkmate
Grassing on a classmate
So beautiful and fortunate
You're the one who hates to love
But he's the one who loves to hate
He can fix you all for good
Because he is the neighbourhood
You can get money for blood
Blood money for doing no good

Better tell me now, have you made your selection?
(Better tell me now, do do-do do do)
Are you ready for correction?
(Better tell me now, do do-do do do)
Cause the wages of sin are an expensive infection
(Better tell me now, do do-do do do)
It'll make you bankrupt
Better pay up now, don't interrupt
I'm so in love, I'm so sincere
Just like a well-known financier
You know I've never been corrupt
I'll pay you a compliment
And you'll think I am innocent
You can total up the balance sheet
And never know if I'm a counterfeit

I'm the bitch that's keepin' it live and keepin' it hot
When you punk-ass niggas don't
Nigga, west side! What?! Bring it on!

Look for me, lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend
Doin' 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind (c'mon)

Our childhood years recall the tears, heart laced with venom
Smokin' sherm, drinkin' malt liquor — father, forgive 'em
Me and my girlfriend, hustlin'
Fell in love with the struggle
Hands on the steering wheel, blush while she bail out bustin'
Fuck 'em all, watch 'em fall screamin'
Automatic gunfire exorcisin' all demons
My mafioso messiah, my congregation high, Ready to Die
We bail out to take the jail back, niggas unite
Our first date, couldn't wait to see you naked
Touch you in every secret place
I could hardly wait to bust freely
Got you red-hot, you so happy to see me
Make the front page, prime time, live on TV
Nigga, my girlfriend, baby 45 but she still live
One shot make a nigga's heartbeat stop

What?! I'm bustin' on you punk-ass niggas
Run, nigga, run! I'm on yo' ass, nigga
Run, nigga! Duck and hide
When I'm bustin' on all you bitches!
Run, nigga! Yeah, Westside!
Uh! Uh! Uh! Die, nigga, die!

My girlfriend blacker than the darkest night
When niggas act bitch-made she got the heart to fight
Nigga, my girlfriend, though we separated at times
I knew deep inside, baby girl would always be mine
Picked you up when you was 9
Started out my life of crime with you
Bought you some shells when you turned 22
It's true, nothin' compares to the satisfaction
That I feel when we out mashin'; me and my girlfriend

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend

I was too immature to understand your ways
Inexperienced back in the days
Caused so many arguments and strays
Now I realize how to treat you, the secret to keep you
Being faithful, ‘cause now cheating's lethal
We're closer than the hands of time
Deeper than the drive of mankind
I trust you dearly, I shoot blind
In time I clock figures, droppin' niggas as we rise
We all soldiers in God's eyes
Now it's time for war, never leave me, baby
I'm paranoid, sleepin' with you loaded by my bedside, crazy
Jealous when you hang with the fellas, I wait patiently alone
Anticipated for the moment you come home
I'm waitin' by the phone, this is true love, I can feel it
I've had a lot of women in my bed, but you the realest
So if you ever need me, call, I'll be there through it all
You're the reason I can stand tall: me and my girlfriend

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend

I love finger-fuckin' you, all of a sudden I'm hearin' thunder
When you bust a nut, niggas be duckin' or takin' numbers
Love to watch you at a block party, beggin' for drama
While unleashin' on the old-timers, that's on my mama
I would trade my life for yours, behind closed doors
The only girl that I adore, everything I'm askin' for
Talkin' to me, beggin' me to just take you around
Seventeen, like Brandy you just Wanna Be Down
Talkin' loud when I tell you be quiet
You move the crowd, bustin' rounds, activatin' a riot
That's why I love you so, no control, down to roll, unleash
After a hit, you break apart, then back to one piece
Much love to my one and only girlfriend, the world is ours
Just hold me down, baby, witness the power
Never leave a nigga alone, I love you black or chrome
Turn this house into a happy home: me and my girlfriend

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin

Trapped in this worldwind
Born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind
Look for me, lost in the whirlwind

Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind
Look for me, lost in the whirlwind

아마 평생 정답은 찾지 못할 그 질문
나란 놈을 고작 말 몇 개로
답할 수 있었다면
신께서 그 수많은 아름다움을
다 만드시진 않았겠지
How you feel? 지금 기분이 어때?
사실 난 너무 좋아 근데 조금 불편해
나는 내가 개인지 돼진지
뭔지도 아직 잘 모르겠는데
남들이 와서 진주목걸일 거네
칵 퉤
예전보단 자주 웃어
소원했던 superhero
이젠 진짜 된 것 같어
근데 갈수록 뭔 말들이 많어
누군 달리라고 누군 멈춰서라 해
얘는 숲을 보라고
걔는 들꽃을 보라 해
내 그림자
나는 망설임이라 쓰고 불렀네
걘 그게 되고 나서
망설인 적이 없었네
무대 아래든 아님 조명 아래든
자꾸 나타나
아지랑이처럼 뜨겁게
자꾸 날 노려보네 oh shit
야 이 짓을 왜 시작한 건지
벌써 잊었냐
넌 그냥 들어주는 누가 있단 게
막 좋았던 거야
가끔은 그냥 싹 다 헛소리 같아
취하면 나오는 거 알지 취기 같아
나 따위가 무슨 music
나 따위가 무슨 truth
나 따위가 무슨 소명
나 따위가 무슨 muse
내가 아는 나의 흠
어쩜 그게 사실 내 전부
세상은 사실 아무 관심 없어
나의 서툼
이제 질리지도 않는 후회들과
매일 밤 징그럽게 뒹굴고
돌릴 길 없는 시간들을
습관처럼 비틀어도
그때마다 날 또 일으켜 세운 것
최초의 질문
내 이름 석 자
그 가장 앞에 와야 할 but

So I'm askin' once again, yeah
Who the hell am I?
Tell me all your names baby
Do you wanna die?
Oh, do you wanna go?
Do you wanna fly?
Where's your soul?
Where's your dream?
Do you think you're alive?

Ah, shit
I don't know man
But I know one thing

Yeah, my name is R
내가 기억하고 사람들이 아는 나
날 토로하기 위해
내가 스스로 만들어낸 나
Yeah 난 날 속여왔을지도
뻥쳐왔을지도 but 부끄럽지 않아
이게 내 영혼의 지도
Dear myself, 넌 절대로 너의 온도를 잃지 마
따뜻히도 차갑게도 될 필요 없으니까
가끔은 위선적이어도 위악적이어도
이게 내가 걸어두고 싶은 내 방향의 척도
내가 되고 싶은 나 사람들이 원하는 나
니가 사랑하는 나 또 내가 빚어내는 나
웃고 있는 나 가끔은 울고 있는 나
지금도 매분 매순간 살아 숨쉬는

Persona
Who the hell am I?
I just wanna go I just wanna fly
I just wanna give you
All the voices 'til I die
I just wanna give you
All the shoulders when you cry

Sometimes all I need is not that far away
Fell out of place today
I could tell by the rate of my heart
That I’d spent too much time awake
Sometimes all I need is just too hard to take
But I felt like I was suffering
So I chose to walk away
And now everytime you see me I’ll be tryna shift the blame

No you don’t wanna touch me now
Or speak too loud
Feeling like the only one left in the room
If it gets brighter when the lights go down
A feeling of what we got lеft and what we’ve been through
Break undеr responsibilities
I’d be safe here if you ever would
So i’ll stay quiet on the way out
You know I’m only passing through

I’m gonna burn away
Just a typical day of my life
I’m not here tryna take the bait
Sometimes all I need is time to make mistakes
If it looks like I’ve been struggling
(it looks like I’ve been struggling)
Might be time to walk away
(Might be time to walk away)
And if everytime you see me
I’m still tryna shift the blame
Know I can’t help it
Can’t take enough for granted
If the world was spinning round
I’d think that I was born to land it

No you don’t wanna touch me now
Or speak too loud
Feeling like the only one left in the room
If it gets brighter when the lights go down
A feeling of what we got left and what we’ve been through
Break under responsibilities
I’d be safe here if you ever would
So i’ll stay quiet on the way out
You know I’m only passing through


Now are you passing through or will you stay a while to notice
Someone was trying to reach you
No you don’t wanna touch me now

Now are you passing through like printer paper cartridge low today

Someone is trying to reach you
Feeling what we got left and what we've been through


No you don’t wanna touch me now
Or speak too loud
Are you passing through or will you stay a while

In the middle of a cold, cold night
It was fourteen below and the wind start to blow
There wasn't a boy scout in sight
Pull down the shade 'cause he's comin'
Turn out the light before he's here
Runnin' hard down the street through the snow and the sleet
On the coldest night of the year

Beware, beware, beware of the naked man
Beware, beware, beware of the naked man

Old lady head up toward Broad Street
Shufflin' uptown against the wind
She had started to cry, wiped a tear from her eye
Looked back to see where she had been

Old lady stand on the corner
With a purse in her hand
She does not know but in a minute or so
She will be robbed by a naked man

Beware, beware, beware of the naked man
Beware, beware, beware of the naked man

Old lady lean against a lamppost
Starin' down at the ground on which she stand
Look up and scream for in the lamplight's beam
There stood the famous naked man

He say, ""They found out about my sister, kicked me out of the Navy
They would have strung me up if they could
I tried to explain that we were both of us lazy
And were doing the best we could""

But he faked to the left, he faked to the right
He snatched the purse from her hand
""Someone stop me,"" he cried as he faded from sight
""Won't nobody help a naked man?""
""Won't nobody help a naked man?""

Came a long and painful road, you gave yourself away
You saw everything, heaven to hell
You said you need a self redemption, to mend the broken wings

Drowning in the dark, no place to be
But I am by your side
You’re not alone

Daylight, shed a light so you won’t disappear
'Cause I know where you belong, save your saddened heart
With a flashback, screaming out but still we’re holding on
Waiting for the break of dawn for a new day to begin

Left out to dry, slip through the hands
Is thеre a reason anymore to keep mе hanging on?
Memories of the past running so fast, can’t look back on yesterday
'Cause I don’t trust in my power
It haunts my weary soul, I’m lonely

Crawling in the dark, nowhere to go
Will you be by my side
Forevermore?

Daylight are you there?
I knew you once before
But the devil in my head has taken over me
Oh, I need your warm embrace to melt my weeping heart
Craving for tomorrow
For a painless day to come

Maybe nothing matters
Still I’m searching for the daylight
Tell me, nothing matters?
I’m waiting for salvation

Now I see it shine, blindness is gone
Rising from the ground
I am alive

Daylight in my eyes, I knew it all along
Fire burning in my soul, to make a better world
I’ve got everything I need with you there by my side
Waiting for the break of dawn, for a new day to begin

Fire burning in my soul
Daylight, daylight
Stay a little while longer"

She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
""Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

6ljbkNIzfmFrGyYUTUAleN,Fort Minor,Remember the Name (feat. Styles of Beyond),0.88,0.835,Q1_Happy,"You ready? Let's go!
Yeah!
For those of you that wanna know what we're all about
It's like this, y'all, c'mon!

This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name (Mike!)

He doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard, whether it's the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
But fuck 'em, he knows the code, it's not about the salary
It's all about reality and making some noise
Making a story, making sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down, Tak's picking it up, let's go

Who the hell is he, anyway? He never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leaving 'em star-struck
Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
That many misjudge him 'cause he makes a living from writing raps
Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never asking for someone's help (Help), or to get some respect ('Spect)
He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
And now it all unfolds the skill of an artist

This is twenty percent skill (Uh), eighty percent beer
Be a hundred percent clear, 'cause Ryu is ill (Next)
Who would've thought he'd be the one to set the west in flames
Then I heard him wreck it with The Crystal Method ""Name of the Game"" (Uh-huh)
Came back, dropped ""Megadef,"" took 'em to church
I like ""Bleach"", man, Ryu had the stupidest verse (Ha-ha)
This dude is the truth, now, everybody giving him guest spots
His stock's through the roof, I heard he fucking with S. Dot

This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

They call him Ryu the Sick, and he's spitting fire with Mike
Got him out the dryer, he's hot, found him in Fort Minor with Tak
What a fucking nihilist, porcupine, he's a prick, he's a cock
The type women wanna be with and rappers hope he gets shot
Eight years in the making, patiently waiting to blow
Now, the record with Shinoda's taking over the globe
He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope
You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat

Tak, he's not your everyday on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got, making his way to the top
He often gets a comment on his name, people keep asking him
""Was it given at birth or does it stand for an acronym?""
No, he's living proof (Proof), got him rocking the booth
He'll get you buzzing quicker than a shot of vodka with juice (Juice)
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they do and give a hundred percent

Forget Mike, nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note and he writes every line
And I've seen him at work, when that light goes on in his mind
It's like a design is written in his head, every time
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
And those motherfuckers he runs with, the kids that he signed?
Ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?

This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

Yeah! Fort Minor, M. Shinoda, Styles of Beyond
Ryu, Takbir, Machine Shop!"

Alright (Can you fill me in?)
Come on
Can you fill me in?
What you want? What you want me to do, baby?
Can you fill me in?
Let's talk about it

I was checkin' this girl next door when her parents went out
She phoned, said, ""Hey boy, come on right around""
So I knock at the door
You were standin' with a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down, start kissing, caressing
Told me about Jacuzzi, sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone
I mean, me and her parents were kind of cool
But they were the fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

Saying, ""Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black
When I left, you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in?""
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle, half the contents gone
Midnight return, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in? (It's another one, it's another one)

Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say, ""Hey girl, come on right around""
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the four by four
Jumped in my ride, checkin' that nobody saw
The club we went in
We got down bounced- bounced to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leavin'
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold
I mean, me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

Saying, ""Why can't you keep your promises no more?
Say you'll be home by twelve, come strolling in at four?
Out with the girls, but leaving with the boy next door""
Can you fill me in? (Fill me in)
Wearing a jacket, whose property?
Said you'd been queuing for a taxi
But you left all your money on the TV (Can you tell me?)
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)

All they seem to do is be checking up on you, baby
(Craig David)
Watchin' our every move
Think someday they might approve, baby

""Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black
When I left, you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)""
Calls diverted to answer phone

Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)"

I remove the nerves from your head, certainly dead
Submarine, 'cause I emerge from the depths
Cut 'em clean, I got no words to be said
Fuck you mean you never heard I'm the best?
Corazon, how they ain't making a noise,
When I roll with my boys, they be turning them red
Shout out to Beppo, there's beasts in my circle of friends
Heart Pirates, but, my gang, we stay heartless
Start fires when I load up the cartridge
Hardwired, I been used to the carnage
War doc, I leave 'em hurt when I give 'em the boot like I'm Marten
Who's fucking asking?
Lay down the Law, I'm not using no pardons
Step in my room and I'm moving compartments
Shambles, break 'em apart like I'm fusing with carbon

Yes, go to war with Apoo
I got beasts on the air and they ready to shoot
I ain't talking my Fruit, you get played like a flute
Ride around with my crew, better give me the loot
Play with the scratch man, bang with a back hand
Strafing the bad lands, crazy, a mad man
Stay in a trash can, gang in the back
Long arm, straying on me, finna spray with the strap, bam
Pulling up with Eustass, Drake get to shooting
And the way we moving, ain't a thang you doing
Bringing pain with music, see, my gang get stupid
Can't avoid my moves and, no, we ain't disputing
If you hear 'em, bet you disappearin'
Hear him fore you see 'em, know you better fear 'em
Shout the coast is clear, they running, can't get near 'em
When it's said and done, the world is gonna revere 'em

Metal, grip it, lead or tin, it's red, I spill it
Get 'em sent into the medic clinic
Magnetic with it, any ferrous dimwits,
They gon' know the score like this is Metacritic
Got some brass bollocks, all these coppers
I'm making them sink, Gibson attack, hear the amp noise
Boy got the gears like it's kling klang klink
Might join together, but don't call 'em me alloys
Law of attraction, chicks getting a feel
Curving all the bullets and I'm bending the steel
Draw them out, I call 'em north and south
I got two poles for 'em if they step in my field
Kid a killer with a Killer, here to kill
The bigger figures and the sinner sycophants
Pin a victim and he'll trim a wicker man
Like, literally, I'm just built different, fam

I got two scythes swinging through the wind,
Leave 'em chopped and trimmed
Used all our luck up, story so fucked up
Where should I begin?
Card always said survival was slim
Mask on my face, I'm hiding my grin
We done lost so many, it's just me and Kidd
So I guess you could say that Killer is pissed
I got two blades, leave 'em toupe'ed, I 'on need a third
Mask on, laughing to myself, I don't say a word
Brodie got the metal for you, cleaving
Never Glock squeezing, that's too easy (Ey)
I must support the ambitions, my captain his wishes
Regardless of whatever problem
All of your struggles fictitious, so sit back and listen
We winnin', don't care what it cost us

For F's sake, X marks the drake
In head mask and cape, our quests aren't the same
I'm steadfast and brave, see breast, ass and faint
Got chest scars and face, double cross, I detest half these fakes
I'm ten times as great, red flag, step back
Them plans get axed when I force the blade
Scratchmen off the list, tell him he lacks skill
'Cause if X won't give it to you, Diax will
Dino-sauring on the high seas, hi, Freeced
Undercover sword, I be the spy team, fight me
Like a carnivore, I'll make a guy meet my teeth
When they Allosaur-us, recognize he's mighty (Ah)
Step into my Zoan, methods are my own
My X Calibur can shatter through their weapons and their bones
I climbed out the barrels from a minion's story
You can find One Piece, but you'll never find Dory

Uh, Jewelry Bonney, I rule these scrawny
Shipmen as I sit and enjoy the bountiful
Foods around me, astounding
The only time I'm over one-hundred-fourty is on my bounty
Only female led captain in the Worst Generation
Racing, my margaritas always moving
I'm a pirate, I'd never help a stranger, young
Or especially old, I'd rather con these losers
Beat by world government, escape the -ish twice
Defeated by Blackbeard, but you saw that kick, right?
My clothes are skin tight, the cost of this spite
Is losing your life quickly with old thin white
Hair, men don't even dare to murder me
I'm on their heads more than my Furażerka green
My Bonnie pirates will forever worship me
And every other Supernova on this Earth will see, yuh

Yeah, man knows my name
Bet they know my face, bet they know my bounty (yes)
It's Big Gang Bege
Crew on my back, couldn't move without me (nah nah)
Roll 'em up and
Smoke these fuckers, we do this loudly
If he bugging, then
He get cut and this crew gon' clown him
You're really not worth the hassle
Man thinks I'm an asshole
Shawty got me bricked up, castle
Judgement drop the hammer like gavel
Ten toes down, you step, you get tread on
New whip, Sherman came with new tread on
Big body, nah, Big Body
You built like a mark, the sharks will get fed on

Listen up, douche, your fate, only I get to choose
Best pray the Arcana spares you
You can get your brain blown like the wind does to straw that I use
You're a doll made to take my abuse, bitch
Play with your life like acoustic
They all Hawking the movements of Basil the ruthless
Came from the North Blue, so you'll never see me get blues if
Something goes south with the crew, shit
Opposition think they damaging me
'Til they take a look at their own bloodied up team
Got captain status, so every chick that's baddest
Tryna be my doll, at max, ten's all I need
Don't fuck with Twelve, we ain't never fuck with authority
Bitch, I'm one of the twelve of the Worst, who really want war with me?
Watch us put two to your head like my head on my Jolly Roger
Move with beasts that'll pirate your life for drawing your sword at me

Heaven 'n' hell, the reverend would tell
These eleven disciples, dead 'em as well
I'm the darkest angel, never enter my realm
If you enter my hell, end up ending yourself
I'm the mad monk, demonic
Probably off the tonic, wilding with the monsters
I been lacking conscious, I been lifeless
And, off the cuff, I crave the carnage
I'm the mad monk, back up
Don't act tough, keep your guard up, ho
Clash us, get flattened
I smash ya, leave you star strucked
I pro'lly pull up with the pillar warning
Darkest archangel, end ya army
Got the sauce, a cross can't even stop me
I'm high above you peasants, you should call me God

Spin and chop and beat an opp like a DJ
Fork path, how I'm in the field cutting three ways
Black Air Force style stepping like CJ
Onigiri, feel the fury of three blades
Cut above the eye, cut above the rest, cut and leave
A motherfucker dead, three swords fly, hit three times
One up in his neck, one up in his chest
One up in his face, put him in his grave
Blade flow like kimono motions, no Wano phase
I am known for the smoke like gelato strains
If I'm lacking, it's like nothing happened
I got a monster body, I can bottle pain
Haki of the Conqueror's got 'em shaking
Like coke, metal pop, now he gotta stain
Steelbite when I chomp on this Wano blade
I took death to the chest, I am not afraid

It's the man of the moment
The elastic opponent the government can't get ahold of
Mad that I'm potent
And I'm packing a mass of support from the vast of the ocean
They know what their role is
My crew serve a purpose, they riding the channel long with me
Can't try to control us
They'll be coming after this con next like a Discord VC
To beat me, you'll need a Marine fleet
And everyone outta any one of the CPs
You could be a Yonko or be a Warlord, you ain't me
Whenever you hear me, my punches on Gear Three
Living life, going merry, I'm cruisin' over
Haki color of the king, I'm ruling over
Coming for you old heads 'til you're all dead, truth be told
Because my future looking bright like a supernova"

Where my crown at? (Ill Will)
Ill Will, rest in peace, let's do it, niggas

(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I'll prove you lost already

Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
What's sad is I love you 'cause you're my brother, you traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women
Were you abused as a child? Scared to smile, they called you ugly?
Well, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was gettin' chased through your building
Callin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was give you a style for you to run with
Smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the God
Wearin' Jaz' chains, no TECs, no cash, no cars
No jail bars, Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan
I'll still whip your ass, you thirty-six in a karate class?
You Tae-Bo ho, tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic?
Ask me if I'm tryna kick knowledge?
Nah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn, though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow (Burn slow)
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy (Ill)
Rocafella died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
Put it together, I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
And now y'all tryna take my spot, fellas?
Feel these hot rocks, fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
In a pine box with nine shots from my Glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot 'cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think, you gettin' girls now 'cause of your looks? (Girls, girls, girls, haha)
Negro, please, ha, you no-mustache-havin'
With whiskers like a rat, compared to Beans, you wack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hangin' with Kane, to Irv, to B.I.G
And Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You a dick-ridin' faggot, you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons, ha
R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick
J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label, gunned up and clapped quick
Shawn Carter to Jay-Z, damn, you on Jaz dick
So little Shawny's gettin' gunned up and clapped quick
How much of Biggie's rhymes is gon' come out your fat lips? (Nigga)
Wanted to be on every last one of my classics
You pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss"

She sat there giggling

I got a shawty and she bad

Thrill seeker, she just wanna move it fast
And my shawty, she bad
On cam, throw it back
Get that bread by any means
Shake that ass, 'cause my shawty, she bad
She finesse with the cash
Got them other folks fiendin' for her mad
Reel it in, she got a catch
No cap, no cap
Bitch, she lovin' all the ways that I act
Got a shawty and she bad

She told me I'm her type
She on a high when we together, enter hyperdrive
She caught a big vibe, this time, been like
How I be spittin', wanna sit by and lie all times
Right there beside me like right now
Come down, baby, let's battle
Everyone pipe down, they out
No one could handle, she like the star now
She been the center attention
Soon as I pop out, it ain't no regular visit
She live the fast life, fast life, she don't wanna leave it
When it's the pastime, pastime, she goin' out drinkin'
She got them big dreams, she living life like she mean it
Before she's six feet under, she live like a demon

And made arrangements
The door was closed, there was a note
I couldn't be bothered, maybe I'll choke
No more engagements

Trying to be good by not being 'round

And here in the bar, the piano man's found

That she computed by watching my eyes
And told me firmly
She couldn't stand it, I'm bad on her heart

Now it concerns me
